u/Ogedei_Khaan,"Is it possible to make a list of counter dialog against Alt-Right communication? I'm noticing a lot of talk online and also in real life with white people utilize a particular style of underhanded compliments/jokes/comments that is usually masked as an actual insult. Even if you are aware of this type of interaction and dialog, you really have to think about it at times. We need to identify and document this type of speech in order to trigger awareness and to create counter dialog that shuts it down. 

Example:

Person A: I really love Asian food and submissive Asian women.

Person B: What does Asian women have to do with Asian food?

Person A: Can't you take a joke? You know that Asian men are responsible for aborting Asian baby girls?

Person B: WTF?

I just made up this example, but it's this type of insult/joke/trivial information/confusion dialog I see popping up all over the place with Alt-Righters. Time we counter and stomp this shit out!",11,2016-12-07 19:29:16,aznidentity,t3_5gdwp6,t3_5gdwp6,dawqrc0,"0"

u/CarlosWongAlmonds,"I have a theory that the attractiveness of a guy is dependent on whether he looks like he could hold his own physically in a fight against the other men who are sexually relevant to the girl (ie the other men that the girl hangs out with).  Hear me out:

I've noticed that non-Asian women who particularly like Asian men but don't *exclusively* hang out with Asian dudes (you included) usually find muscular, larger (read: men that /u/the0clean0slate would like more, lol) Asian men more attractive than K-pop-styled guys.  

Why? Let's take you as an example - you said that you were black.  You'll likely still hang around a significant proportion of black/white dudes, and you'll still consume white/black media to some extent.  *You are unable to find an Asian guy attractive if he doesn't look like he can at least hold his own in a fight against those black/white guys*.  So for you, the K-pop look isn't as attractive as the muscular Asian guy because a) the K-pop guy is usually skinnier and b) the K-pop guy doesn't look like he's as physically aggressive wrt fighting other men as a muscular Asian guy.

That's not to say that you (and other non-Asian women who are particularly into Asian guys) don't also like the K-pop style - but you guys just don't like it as much as you do the muscular Asian dude.

Similarly, when whitewashed Asian girls (ie the ones that hang out with white/black/Latino men *as well as* Asian guys) date Asian guys, they almost always go for the muscular Asian guy instead of the K-pop styled Asian guy.

Even ABGs (who would usually only hang out with 'thuggier' Asian guys) will mostly find muscular Asian guys attractive over K-pop-styled guys.

But because K-pop-styled guys look good and have a great emphasis on fashion, they usually find great success too - but mostly with Asian girls who exclusively hang out with non-thuggish Asian guys who aren't as physically aggressive.

This sounds like I'm shitting on K-pop-styled Asian guys and that I'm saying that K-pop-styled Asian guys aren't usually muscular/aggressive and I sound like a Chan.  I'm very aware of that.  I'm also not ignoring that northern Chinese and Korean guys (especially FOBs) are often very big and willing to fight.

But as a guy that's gone from skinny and pretty with longer hair, to less pretty with shorter hair and with more muscles and with a more 'aggressive' demeanor, I've found that when I was more pretty and skinnier I would only get Asian girls who hung out with less 'thuggish' Asian guys, while as a more muscular guy with a more aggressive demeanor I get attraction from Asian girls who hang out with white/black/Latino/and more 'thuggish' Asian guys too.

And you know what was the most striking? As a skinny pretty boy, I wouldn't usually get any attention from northern Chinese FOB girls, but with shorter hair and more muscles and a more aggressive demeanor I would get more attention from northern Chinese FOB girls.  Is this because northern Chinese FOB men are stereotypically more physically aggressive/larger? I think so.

u/ankistar,"I met my SO at a social event related to our hobby where we were seated next to each other. We have similar interests, eat high protein meals, eat more than 3 meals a day, and have similar taste in foods (eg dongbei, shanghai,and yue but not sichuan chinese, vietnamese, pho, korean, kbbq, steak, meat&amp;potatoes, borscht, mediterranean, lots of and all kinds of dairy). We both value health, spending time together, investment, service, and enjoying the simple things over having new or shiny things. It's great having an SO to meal prep and lift together. 

In the past Ive had girls approach me at school, house parties, nightclubs, and at a cosplay festival. Ive approached girls at school, house parties, and nightclubs. 

The few viable amaw scenes in the US include the asian frat/sorority scene and certain enclave subcultures like the Azn/ABG scene and the [KTown](http://disgrasian.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gallery_enlarged-42899PCN_Ktown11wtmk-550x366.jpg) scene (I really miss that show). 

Currently in the US, there might be more am *only* interested in aw than there are aw open to am *at all*. So honestly, it seems that encouraging or giving false hope to asian guys who insist on dating only asian women is just putting them in the position of a choosing beggar. 

 I have am friends with non-asian SOs who get along very well in circles of both am and aw. Overall it seems non-asian women with asian SOs are much more  natural with hanging out with both asian guys and girls than non-asian men are. 

I'd say if you're in a amaw friendly scene, you'd probably already be in amaw. If not, it's better to adapt. Don't see women as asian or not, just see them as women.

u/Seamen_On_Poop_Deck,"Been to all the major cities in Canada and lived in Toronto and Vancouver. That being said Vancouver and Toronto are the Asian metropolises. 

Vancouver having mainly Asians as the largest minority group but little diversity outside of whites, Asians and brown people. Vancouver is considered the most Asian city outside of Asia. Toronto is the most multicultural city in the world beating out NYC and London and just over 50% of the population as foreign born and 50% white and their number is decreasing. There's so many people all over the world here that I don't even feel like a minority. Most my friends in Toronto are all in AMAF relationships but like any city there's WMAF anywhere.

There's casual racism but in my opinion it isn't as bad as America, UK or Australia. I personally haven't encountered any racism in a while. However, I felt that Vancouver was more hostile towards asians due to its Anti-Asian history being the port where the first Asian immigrants arrived back in the day and that still reflects back to today in a way. 

I find Toronto to be great. Just go north of Toronto to Markham/Richmond hill where the enclaves are and you can see that a lot of 2nd+ generation AMAF people together and have a strong sense of Asian identity.

u/An_Asiatic_Vampire,"I think this can’t be overstated.

Too many AMs overlook maximizing their esthetics. I don’t want to sound overly judgmental but there are guys who pay no mind to their body, hair, skin, teeth, or clothing, and if they have trouble getting dates, well now, you get what you put in.

Forget white men for a second, I see Latino and Black guys putting lots of effort into their appearance. They understand that even something as simple as going to the super market warrants meticulous care to one’s outward appearance. I saw a Latino guy who was short, yet had great hair, great skin, very nice clothes that complemented his build, and was in great shape. He even plucked his eyebrows. It was clear to me that he really cared about his appearance. And then next to him was a 6 foot tall, skinny fat Asian guy in sweat pants, with messy hair, bad skin, and pretty much looked like he just rolled out of bed. Of course the 5’ 7” Latino guy AMOGGED the tall Asian. *Yes there is institutional racism.* *Yes there are legitimate handicaps holding back AM.* But I don’t think all that really applies in this situation, I mean, not to sound like a jerk, but I wouldn’t want to date that AM. 

And of course just today I saw an AM with a 9/10 ABG style Asian girlfriend.

u/thecontemplativeman,"""I too once thought I'd spend my future with a nice Singapore girl, but lol, they're all asleep.""
""Most people here don't even think about these things.""

Bro, be courageous and look past that. I'm sure many of us thought from young that Western looks were desirable or that the West is somehow cooler. But this is something people grow out of eventually. Also, people don't automatically become exposed to theories on AI because we lack the framework, and we lack the content that's here back in Singapore. If you are aware of these issues then it is a responsibility to take your message into your society. It's like NS - if it's not up to us to defend Singapore then who will? If it's not up to us to bring our message home, then who will? Government scholars studying in Western countries are mostly much too content with their studies, positions and career tracks when they head back home to create change. It's up to you and me to be the change we want to see.

Fight for Singaporean girls. Why they think the way they do is because society taught them to think that way. Singaporean guys say the same shit too, and if our gals see that we won't fight for them, they won't either. This is what divides us. If you think about it the ABG trend in America is likely a response by azn girls against the stronghold that white girls have on media and beauty standards in the West. Isn't that the same shit Asian guys face? 

I don't automatically divide Asians into chans &amp; lus, and woke and unwoke, though I do observe behaviors and mannerisms that inform me about whether someone is woke or not. I see chans &amp; lus not as foes, but as people who need to be awakened. When I see an Asian guy who's with a white friend, but said Asian guy seems completely beta and defer way too much for his own good to said white guy, I'll make sure to step in and be assertive with the white guy on his behalf. I'll make it a point to the Asian guy to let him know that Asians can be leaders, alphas and assertive by nature whether a white guy likes it or not. 

I tend to ignore Lus because I think they feed off the attention that you give them. If an Asian girl with a white bf tries to talk to me or join in a social circle with me in it, I make it a point to be aggressive and assertive against the white guy and show the Asian gal that I'm not going to defer to her just cos her bf is white. This means speaking with force and conviction, and daring to stand up against what said white guy says or thinks if you detect casual racism and not being chummy with him. Because this is how Asians in Singapore think - 'knowing a white guy increases my social value'. Ergo, she's not gonna get to climb some ladder for social status in my eyes by virtue of who she dates. Also, if your social circle is Asian, I make sure white guy doesn't get too much attention just by virtue of being white, and I will step into conversations to direct them to local topics that the majority can connect with to show white guy that either you assimilate into our culture and expectations, or you're an outsider. Especially since I have experience in the Western world, Singaporeans are more likely to be interested in my thoughts on those topics by virtue of me being local. Cos white guys with Asian gfs probably feed off and crave the attention Asian circles give too. 

Most importantly, Asian girls with White guys hate it when they see a completely loving Asian-Asian couple, because this destroys their worldview that their pairing is best (or the most romantic). If there is an Asian girl in the group I like or have a thing for, I'll be flirty and give her romantic attention. Things like looking at her with sultry eyes, rubbing noses, smiling as I inch myself closer, biting and licking my lips while I speak to her, and maybe even holding hands or feeding her food. And I will ignore the WMAF pairing because they become irrelevant in my eyes.

u/Handsome_Golden_Boy,"AsAM guys who grew up in the hood or with hip hop or thug culture do much better than their white washed, preppie counterparts.

I’ve seen enough of both demographics to confidently make that claim. I think having a difficult, uncertain childhood makes guys develop a killer instinct and a certain level of swag that can really make up for one’s race. 

Just recently, at EDC I saw short, average to above average looking, thugged out Asians with super hot ABG girlfriends.",21,2018-05-27 06:08:07,aznidentity,t3_8mfqyd,t3_8mfqyd,dznamdt,"0"
u/ConfuciusCuckedUs,"&gt; Bro, be courageous and look past that. I'm sure many of us thought from young that Western looks were desirable or that the West is somehow cooler. But this is something people grow out of eventually. Also, people don't automatically become exposed to theories on AI because we lack the framework, and we lack the content that's here back in Singapore. If you are aware of these issues then it is a responsibility to take your message into your society. It's like NS - if it's not up to us to defend Singapore then who will? If it's not up to us to bring our message home, then who will? Government scholars studying in Western countries are mostly much too content with their studies, positions and career tracks when they head back home to create change. It's up to you and me to be the change we want to see.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Fight for Singaporean girls. Why they think the way they do is because society taught them to think that way. Singaporean guys say the same shit too, and if our gals see that we won't fight for them, they won't either. This is what divides us. If you think about it the ABG trend in America is likely a response by azn girls against the stronghold that white girls have on media and beauty standards in the West. Isn't that the same shit Asian guys face?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't automatically divide Asians into chans &amp; lus, and woke and unwoke, though I do observe behaviors and mannerisms that inform me about whether someone is woke or not. I see chans &amp; lus not as foes, but as people who need to be awakened. When I see an Asian guy who's with a white friend, but said Asian guy seems completely beta and defer way too much for his own good to said white guy, I'll make sure to step in and be assertive with the white guy on his behalf. I'll make it a point to the Asian guy to let him know that Asians can be leaders, alphas and assertive by nature whether a white guy likes it or not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I tend to ignore Lus because I think they feed off the attention that you give them. If an Asian girl with a white bf tries to talk to me or join in a social circle with me in it, I make it a point to be aggressive and assertive against the white guy and show the Asian gal that I'm not going to defer to her just cos her bf is white. This means speaking with force and conviction, and daring to stand up against what said white guy says or thinks if you detect casual racism and not being chummy with him. Because this is how Asians in Singapore think - 'knowing a white guy increases my social value'. Ergo, she's not gonna get to climb some ladder for social status in my eyes by virtue of who she dates. Also, if your social circle is Asian, I make sure white guy doesn't get too much attention just by virtue of being white, and I will step into conversations to direct them to local topics that the majority can connect with to show white guy that either you assimilate into our culture and expectations, or you're an outsider. Especially since I have experience in the Western world, Singaporeans are more likely to be interested in my thoughts on those topics by virtue of me being local. Cos white guys with Asian gfs probably feed off and crave the attention Asian circles give too.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Most importantly, Asian girls with White guys hate it when they see a completely loving Asian-Asian couple, because this destroys their worldview that their pairing is best (or the most romantic). If there is an Asian girl in the group I like or have a thing for, I'll be flirty and give her romantic attention. Things like looking at her with sultry eyes, rubbing noses, smiling as I inch myself closer, biting and licking my lips while I speak to her, and maybe even holding hands or feeding her food. And I will ignore the WMAF pairing because they become irrelevant in my eyes. I let them know that I don't see their pairing as superior, and that I will be content with a girl I love whether they like it or not. Because many of these pairings aren't based on true love, but a superficial one that gets validated on the outside by society. You'll be amazed at how many WMAF pairs in the States give me a look and leave swiftly when they see an AMAF doing that stuff. You need to let the gal you love know that you are the option for her and you can be as romantic, or way more so than a white guy.

For the bit where you said Chans and Lus need to be awakened. Sure, it's good for us if they are; but I'd draw a line at having a relationship with Lus - isn't that what people here call a bananarang?

and the problem with AFs, even the ones in Singapore, is that since they're all asleep, you don't really know which one of them are latent Lus, so to speak. Contrary to what you suggest, in my own circles, it's not that uncommon for Singapore girls (Chinese) to talk about cute mixed babies and go crazy about WM like Chris Hemsworth. Sure there's nothing wrong in that, but it sure doesn't leave one confident about whether they're a non-Lu. Also, anecdotally, when Singapore AF get a chance, many go WM (especially the tall Chinese girls).

As for how you treat WMAF I totally agree. Fucking hell in Singapore they're almost celebrities by default, especially their offspring.

As for bringing the fight back here, it's still an ang moh's world - rock the boat and it's sayonara to your career. 

but in any case, thanks, it's food for thought - I'll keep think about your ideas and keep them in mind.",1,2018-05-29 08:19:43,aznidentity,t3_8liykk,t1_dzmttaj,dzr58fa,"0"
u/ferrousir,"The pictures of the beheading you posted are not of Chinese. 

The beheading pictures are of Madurese Muslims who were beheaded in the 1999 Sambas riots and Sampit incident in 2001. The pictures of bodies being dragged on motorcycles are of Indonesian Muslims suspected of being witches in Banyuwangi who were slaughtered by mobs accusing them of black magic. They were mislabelled as Chinese people.

May 1998 was mostly looting and rapes directed against the Chinese community in Jakarta. there was no dragging on motorcycles going on.

Nobody took pictures of the violence in May 1998. If you find something on the internet that says its a victim of May 1998, its not, because the attackers did not take photos.

Sambas is different because the Dayaks were proud of what they did and showed the beheaded Madurese to the cameras.

Be aware, that there are no actual photos on the internet available of the violence in the May 1998 riots. Rapists (not surprisingly) did not take photos of their victims bodies. None of the Indonesian attackers posted photos of what they did.

There are only photos of the looting from May 1998.

There are plenty of photos from Sambas riots, because the Malays and Dayaks were proud that they beheaded Madurese people and were even waving the heads in front of western journalists. They were boasting on how they were cleansing their land of Madurese and the Malays celebrated it by drawing a painting.

The Dayaks who beheaded Madurese wore the red headbands and red armbands as a sign of their movement. These was a picture of a Dayak holding a big blade with red armband. with Madurese beheaded corpses in the background.

Someone took that picture, and claimed its of an Indonesian Javanese standing next to Chinese bodies.

These are also the infamous pictures of Madurese heads piled up by Dayaks on the sides of streets in Sambas.

Someone reposted them, and said they are Chinese heads.

This is a picture of Dayaks waving the heads of Madurese children while riding on motorbikes.

u/alekto_,"Clarissa serves as a complicated example: she reigns supreme to most AF in terms of cultural awareness, but is penalized for not adequately meeting western or asian standards of beauty.

IMO, Clarissa is exceedingly more thoughtful, culturally knowledgeable, and genuinely invested in the history and practices of Asian food culture - esp Chinese food - than the average AF. She's dedicated her career at this point to learning, preserving, and sharing Asian food culture as a journalist / food writer, while the average ABG AF is on IG masquerading as a bi-culturally suave foodie bc of their \*yelp elite\* status - who captions run of the mill dim sum plates with puns on Saturdays and boomarangs fried chicken and donuts / bottomless mimosas on Sundays.

It's not even close.

I think our community and IG / media culture have done a grave disservice here; she's not getting the recognition she deserves on a food culture level within a highly white male dominated industry, but she's also doubly slighted by the 'social media' world that places a premium on pretty-faced, AFs who may have little to no knowledge of Asian/Asian American history/food culture but have amassed 170K+ followers. 

Looking at her IG and following, I honestly wonder whether we can say as a community that we have adequately supported her.

I'm not discounting the role of internalized racism - there is something to be said about all the white worship dynamics in Taiwan that you mentioned. Just wanted to add that I suspect, as u/993366 noted, that a key factor here is that *she is being treated inferiorly* by how she looks in contrast to other AF.

People on the sub have noted that American-Born Chinese/Taiwanese men are highly sought after by AF in Taiwan -  if they have their pick of AF, I'd wager then it's Clarissa's options that prompted her to date out.",12,2018-06-26 21:32:08,aznidentity,t3_8tzdsk,t3_8tzdsk,e1cdw5a,"0"
u/Handsome_Golden_Boy,"Man forget height and having a handsome face. 
Please consider my “thesis”’here, if you will. It’s a bit of a rambling argument but It will make sense in the end

Ok, In some areas, I see a bunch of short, average looking Vietnamese guys with the hottest ABG Asian girlfriends. Some of these girls are taller than the men. How? Why?? Well, these men all have one thing in common: they are hella thugged out. They grew up in rough neighborhoods, and developed a swag and resiliency that is hard to cultivate if you grew up in a white washed preppy environment. (I also see the same thing with short Mexican men with taller, hot Mexican girlfriend).

I’m not asking you to be something you are not and go for a hip hop aesthetic. No. My point is **women ultimately respect strong, violent (when necessary), resilient men. It just so happens certain facial features and height signals these attributes. But if you don’t have those, you need to find alternate ways to signal this.**

Think of how many violent criminals and killers have women falling in love with them, wanting to fuck them. Many of these men are ugly and short, and fall short of the “Chad” aesthetic that incels love to obsess over.

Nobody wanted to fuck Elliot Rodger, but after he killed a bunch of people, all of a sudden women wanted to fuck him. There are entire fan clubs and communities run by women devoted to him, arguably the king of the Incels. 

Again, not asking you to be a killer or a thug, but I mention all this to help you break down your obsession with your face and height. Remember, it’s not necesssrily those features in isolation that are attractive, but also what those features signal. Signal. Signal. And they signal toughness, ability to protect, resilence. 

u/the0clean0slate et al. have all given you great advice. And it simply boils down to cultivating that warrior mentality and getting tougher mentally and physically, in order to signal that you are indeed capable of protecting and being violent when needed. if you get in great shape, learn to fight and become proficient at MMA, and start taking out guys taller and more handsome than you at the local gym, you will get girl’s pussy wet guaranteed. 

Now, if you take this newly found martial arts ability to be violent/dangerous and you pair it with being funny, witty, and nice, now you have become a paradox. And women are drawn to contradictions in people. For instance, the heart surgeon with tattoos who’s also an artist. Or the astrophysicist who plays in a rock band.

Lastly I suspect you are from the Incel subs. Please stay away from those places, you will literally die there. It’s not worth it.

u/JayKim25,"For a lot of Korean Americans, I just think that there's this mentality that puts white people above other Asians, whereas other Asians are somewhat cool with befriending Asians from different backgrounds. 

I remember so many times where my mom would always bitch at me for dating non-Korean Asians. She'd always be like ""No, No, No way"" every time I told her I was dating Americanized Chinese, Filipino, or Vietnamese girls. It'd always end up into a fight, where I'd win the shouting match, but my mom always went into her room with that disappointed look and talking to herself like Korean ahjummas lol. 

And there were two times when I was actually dating Korean American girls in which my mom did the same ""No, No"" bullshit when I showed her our photos. Because these girls didn't have that Korean look; they were tanned, dressed in that Asian baby girl style, and had that bad girl vibe lol. 

She also supported McCain during the 2008 election because he was a white guy lol. That was literally the only reason lol. 

She's mellowed out a lot these days. And as we've gotten older, she doesn't harp on me as much to marry anymore.

u/Stoxastic,"I grew up in the Midwest (SE Michigan), wasn't as bad as this picture but generally do not recommend. Even though big cities are better, the northern Midwest can get really rednecky. Had a friend in high school to transferred from a redneck school district. He was a pretty open minded guy, but whenever I met his friends from his previous school they pretty much did the typical ching chong shit. They're all Trump blowhards at this point. 

I don't have experience growing up in an enclave but I do think it is better. However, some of the culture coming from there (like wearing supreme) is pretty foreign to me, as a Midwest Asian American. Like I have never met an ABG growing up lol. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of SoCal Asians like Fung Bros and feel super  unrelatable to them. 

Midwest Asians are super vanilla. Very stereotypical all study no play. The small Asian communities in the Midwest also revolve around Christianity, for some reason. My family is Chinese and we grew up secular. After I went to college and my mom didn't need to take care of kids anymore she started making friends in various Church groups and was baptized.

I actually settled down in the south now in Atlanta, and it's way better. Very diverse Asian community of a decently large size.",3,2018-11-14 14:55:01,aznidentity,t3_9wvnbu,t3_9wvnbu,e9ol4ek,"0"

u/HenryHwang,"I think I’m the only one at my school who steps up and calls out racism, or casual racism against Asians. Most of the Asians at my school stay quiet or go along with the insensitive jokes. You got Hispanics in one corner calling us “chinos/chinitos” and black people in the other corner talking about how we eat “pets”. Then you would hear about Asians having small dicks from them every now and then. White people are nearly nonexistent here since it’s a minority-majority area, so don’t worry about them. Anyways, I bust every single one of them. I would put in their faces equally offensive things and shut them up.

Now let’s discuss our people over here. The AMs are pretty chill, and you can see a huge diversity within them. You have some nerdy AMs here, and some of the “model” AMs there. By model, I mean masculine and really good-looking. I walk on the line between nerdiness and masculinity, leaning more towards nerdiness. Tryna get in that masculinity at the gym, and I still have a way to go. As for AFs, the same thing applies for them. Mix of nerdy girls and ABGs, and very nice people. If you’re wondering about the dating circumstances here, AMs and AFs are willing to date each other. That’s as much as I’ll say about that.

This is my report for my area. Life is good, and we have established our place here. More people are respectful towards our kind, and we aren’t really seen as FOBs anymore. I always read about unfortunate stories for us take occurs elsewhere in this country, which makes me sad. I hope things turn around and communities around the country become more like the one I live in.

u/CarlosWongAlmonds,"They certainly get a lot *more* positive attention from women, although such traits aren't necessary.  But yes, being jacked/tattooed/looking like a douchebag (all stereotypically masculine things) are good for attracting girls regardless of race but it works doubly well for Asian men because AM are prescribed un-masculine steroetypes.

And yes that works for non-Asian girls, but also let's be honest, unless the guy is high-status/rich/naturally handsome, all of the Asian-American players I know that slay in Asian-American circles (think your Lambda frat boys, the guys running shit in AA circles in LA/New York) are jacked and/or tattooed.

I've theorized a long time ago that the hottest ABGs (those almost exclusively into Asian guys) are doubly attracted to the most masculine/douchey Asian guys - because the hottest ABGs will get a ton of unwanted attention from non-Asian guys and they *need* a boyfriend who can adequately physically defend them.

The Asian guys I know who do really really well (again, especially in Asian-American as opposed to 1.5gen/FOB circles, ie the circles with the hottest Asian-American girls) are the dudes who look like Randall Pich or Adam Pu (tattooed, gangbanger vibe).

If you're East Asian techie and work in SV:

- then move to anywhere else, and use the Bay Area experience to **NEGOTIATE YOUR PAY**

I cannot stress this enough. You can make just as much money elsewhere (in relation to cost of living), if you know how to negotiate.

The money you save during those 4 years (plus the vested stock) will help you get that first downpayment on a house - and by moving OUT of SV, you won't be getting a shoebox.

And yes, you're screwed when it comes to dating. You'll either run into:

- the typical Lu

- the wannabe ABG Lu

- the nerdy/tech Lu

- the bananarang

- the FOB Asian girl who has her amazing FOB boyfriend

u/dasdemit,"Brother  there are some miss information. First Mongols were originated eastern Mongolia and far north of mancuria they    they were originated from donghu( eastern Barbarian  ) including tunguz people. Around 150 BC turkic ruling Xiognu absorbed defeated donghu and  huge junk  of Mongol ancestor's were absorbed and introduced turkic cultures and religion. So in ancient times Mongol religion was animistic mixed with  polytheistic so after they liven among  turkic people and  turkic tengrism they heavily influenced by turkic culture and religion . For example 
Chengiz Khan  name come from Turkic jengiz , dingiz , deniz( sea ,ocean ) his dynasty name börütigin  comes from turkic (wolf prince) temurjin means turkic (demirci- ironsmitter)  ancient turkic were nicknamed Ironsmitter.  It's clearly to see that their culture  is very influenced by turkic culture. Their alfabets were introduced by uygur turkic script's.  So after so many years later in 10 century  they introduce polytheistic Tengrism during mongol invasion so turkic tengrism  were disappeared today.  And word Tengri is actually 100% turkic  Chinese tian 

As for  racial   explanation ...  Turkic live Central Asian betweens Asian and indo-European  people very large area so ancient times many historian split them in 2  
Western show more indo-European while Eastern show more Asian.  Even in ancient time blond hair , redhead  green eyes and Blue eyes were common in turkic people. Today even Asian blond is common  in uygur turkic people So when oghuz Turks emigrated to turkey 9 centuriy they were more indo-European not Asian..   so Huns, avars and kipchak such as kirgiz, kazak tatars show more Asian traits while cuman who emigrated to Hungaria and disappeared were blond. 

 As for Korea ,  well! During northern Wei. Tabgach and many other Turkic and Mongols had relations with Korea also   it's known that Turkic Celestial TURK (Göktürk) had  relations with ancestor's of korea  see SUI  Korea war...  And during Mongol  invasion there were also multiple things introduced...

Japan : just like Korea the Japan during kofun period believed some of them  crossed Japan made clan systems. You will see similar tümülüs (grave tombs) ..  for example 

Japanese / English /Turkish 

Nande / why / neden 
Kuro / black / Kara 
Yama/ hill / yamac hillside/ etc etc etc ...

So turkic history is very wide  you have to look multiple historical sources..",1,2019-01-29 15:44:40,aznidentity,t3_akeb6k,t3_akeb6k,ef9oofc,"0"

I think american culture sexualizes girls from a young age - i.e. rap culture, frat culture, even the ABG culture.

u/throwaway628628628,"thanks for replying haha ur 2c were really interesting!! i’ve heard that it’s pretty diverse/there’s a lot of asians in ny so i thought it would be similar to california, it’s interesting that your experience being aa is so different. what do u mean by AA being divided? do you mean that they’re divided by whether they reject or embrace their cultural identity? 
i think i get your point about having a your own “bubble”, a group where you truly feel like you fit in. i never really thought about being asian american in the context of self hate. to me the biggest differences between my friends were the ones who were born abroad and grew up here/have immigrant parents vs ones who had parents who grew up here. sometimes i actually feel like i’m not asian enough, since my friends speak their native language fluently and are more in touch with their culture.
i also wonder if there’s a generational difference coming into play. it sounds like your already done w/ school/part of the workforce, so you’re probs older than me. idk haha you might be around my age tho so if i’m wrong sry (￣▽￣"""")
about dating outside, i’ve never really experienced it but i’ll def keep in mind ur advice about having self awareness. obviously i don’t think objectification is a good thing regardless if it “works for me” and i’m not going to be a young women forever so whatever “advantages” it gives me are fleeting and meaningless.
haha yea i’ve heard in general the west coast is more “chill” than the east coast (like how we dress, etc). i’m assuming boba is big w asians everywhere, as is foodie culture, and to some extent anime, but i was wondering if other things were different. for example, there are (young) cali asians who rave, drink a lot, go clubbing, look like abgs, get fades, wear earrings, get tattoos, say the n word (WHICH I HATE), are usually biology/pre-med or cs and i was wondering if that breed of asian is particular to cali or if you find them everywhere.",2,2019-05-29 08:12:32,aznidentity,t3_btrwcs,t1_ep38ixz,ep9wn0y,"0"

Part of it is sadly, people in general don't feel the need to put as much effort when dating AM, but also when it comes to excessive cosmetics/surgery, usually people that partake are particularly insecure people that seek an unhealthy amount of external social approval, of which white people, particularly white men are the gatekeepers of.  

The only exception is the ABG look with dyed hair, fake lashes, eyeliner, breast enlargement, possibly coloured contacts.

u/CloudReflection,"I know this is an unpopular opinion on here but I’ve been having some second thoughts on Ken Jeong.

Yesterday I listened to the podcast episode of ABG with Simu Liu and he said when he knew nobody and moved down to LA to look for work he instinctively hit up any other Asians he knew in the area, with Ken Jeong being one of them. Now despite them having nothing in common except being Asian, Simu said Ken gave him a place to stay, was extremely encouraging and offered to bring him to his sets to see how it all played out. Not only did this provide the obvious benefits, but it also gave Simu a sense of optimism when it came to cold-approaching others in the acting industry.

I know this doesn’t excuse his terrible representation, but it did get me thinking that perhaps life isn’t as black and white as we make it out to be. I think we can all agree that Simu is one of the best things ever for Asian male representation we’ve seen so far, and he had nothing but respect for Ken.

It makes me wonder if in his mind, Ken Jeong genuinely thinks he’s advancing Asian representation in Hollywood by at least being seen? Even though I don’t agree with that, I think it’s out of character for actual self-hating uncle Toms and uncle Chans to extend help to their own people.

These girls are not the partying/raving ABG types - they’re med school, law school, top engineering students who want a partner that’s as accomplished as them and family-oriented, and those are not as commonly found values among the general white male population than other upper middle class children of Asian immigrants.

They've been constantly told by their family that they're ""fat,"" ""chubby,"" ""tanned,"" have fucked up facial features, etc. And on top of that, Asians in Asian circles think she's a fucking weirdo. 

So when this weirdo Asian girl gets some kind of attention from the loserish white guy, it means the whole world to her. Its like, they've realized that they were hot all this time, but were repressed by the ""misogynistic/patriarchal"" Asians lol. 

So in order to validate her ""hotness,"" she's gonna post up her porn shit to show off her ""hot body"" lol. And a lot of the loserish white guys are going to give her attention and tell her she's an ""ABG,"" when in fact she'd be way below average in Asian circles. 

So now with this new self-confidence and the realization that she's ""hot,"" any little criticism that Asian men and women from Asian circles tell her, she's gonna get real defensive and talk about misogyny and patriarchy lol. The Asian man is the most evil being on the planet to her, because they're the ones who repressed her ""hotness"" lol. So whatever an Asian man has to say something, its misogyny and patriarchy lol.",9,2020-05-21 22:58:47,aznidentity,t3_go0p8b,t3_go0p8b,fre4s33,"0"

Where in my post did I say to give an angry repsonse? **Don't twist my words.** I simply said to not take their words seriously as they have no credibility.

Also speak for yourself. In highschool when I still interacted with whites, it became very clear that top tier white boys did not like asian women. Don't call me racist as I'm just paraphrasing, but they straight up said asian women were ugly, flat boobs, flat face, no ass etc. Of course there were exceptions such as hapas that clearly looked white/latina.

Most of the top tier asian women/abg's exclusively date asian men and only hang out in asian enclaves. Trust me most of them do not like white bois.

I do think there are traditional cultural influences with what AM vs WM expect in women. Unfortunately in America where women DO have to be assertive and independent, in addition to not caring as much to be skinny and demure turns a lot of AM off. 

When you hear about an AM dating someone, do you ever imagine them to be over 5’8, over size 8, loud, with a liberal arts job (wildlife photographer, artist, teacher, etc), or do you imagine them to be more petite, respectful, and reserved with a “good” job (doctor, lawyer, pharmacist, accountant, scientist, etc) woman?

Different aspects of various cultures in Asia have definitely gained popularity in recent years.

I think that women in general like things beauty related and sometimes enjoy experimenting with different things. Like I personally found it to be really fun to try different hair colours.

I'm convinced she has absolutely no idea what an ABG even is. She's listing Awkwafina as an ""ABG prominent Asian film actress"". AWKWAFINA???? I've seen the term diluted to where any asian girl with falsies and blond hair gets called one now, but seeing Awkwafina get called one is new to me.

Anytime something asian gets a bit of hype from the ""mainstream"" you get these people that ain't never wanted shit to do with it before trying to jump on the bandwagon.

Type of people that'll try to dissociate from anything asian unless it's palatable to a mainstream western audience. Won't ever rep the chicken feet, or stinky tofu but go out of their way to show off their boba, sushi, whatever else is acceptable.

u/[deleted],"ABG/ABB culture originated in Asian gang culture from Asian enclaves in the 90s-late 2000s. Well before social media. It also incorporated a lot of edm rave culture, the JDM car scene/import shows, and partying overall. It was its OWN organic aesthetic and culture. It just now has been repurposed and repackaged in a softer form in modern day due to the Asian fraternity/sorority scene, boba culture, and social media. I don’t see where the appropriation of black culture/ anti-blackness is located. It’s VERY much a western Asian culture thing. A lot of younger Asians aren’t even familiar with this history, only what they see right here and now. Also a lot of Asians that did not grow up in Asian enclaves or with Asian gangs around do not understand the origins of this culture. Hence you have this clueless Asian, Lucy Tu, writing an off base article for Harvard.

I personally grew up with this kind of culture around me and with Asians 10-15 years older than me that were into this culture. When I went to college in another city, I met Asians that were not from Asian enclaves. These types of Asians were completely oblivious to this culture and usually were white washed or assimilated to whatever culture was most dominant around them. This was early social media days btw.

Not sure of his age group but the idea that anti-blackness is pervasive and common in the Asian community is pushed heavily in social media and colleges. Such as with Harvard:

&gt; However, we must acknowledge that Asian Americans are not merely bystanders but often perpetrators of anti-Blackness. For instance, the social media trope of “Asian Baby Girls,” or ABGs, embodies the appropriation of Black culture in many ways. While ABG Instagram influencers, TikTok stars, and even prominent Asian film actresses are labeled as “funny” or “aesthetic” for their “blaccents”, Black individuals are stereotyped for their use of African-American vernacular.

I grew up upper middle class from 2 immigrant parents so I associated southern and central Chinese with upper middle class Chinese  immigrant culture but not all noveau rich or fancy like northern chinese, poorer southern chinese in America with inner city life/gang  life and the original 90s/early 2000s ABG style (as well as Vietnamese) on the west coast or just well, Chinatown people on both the east and west coasts. While I view northern ch in see with all that you stated as well as having good fashion sense lol",1,2021-05-21 20:01:46,aznidentity,t3_mx79fa,t1_gyzabir,gyzbn7l,"0"
u/elBottoo,"Update: so I was in a rush this morning, so half posted this comment.

So here is what happens. The trailer itself looks innocent enough. Just a shark movie, no politics and stuff. And you can see 2 asians in there, so I decided to give it a go on a bored night.

Immediately when the movie begins, the asians arrive in a fancy car complete with drivers. They get out the car and immediately start to look around and judge the place. So you already given the impression that they are snobs. They introduce themselves. So far so good.

The aboriginal guy starts staring at the asian woman and the asian guy noticed. Immediately he treats him like a baggage boy and rude. He throws his backpack, no he rams his backpack into the aboriginal guys chest, ""take my stuff boy, and is he also coming along?"" Purpose: to show Asian male is violent, agressive, racist, unreasonable, overjealous and toxic.

WM and ABM just brush it off and laugh. Purpose: to show that they are reasonable people and friendly, to show that they are best friends.

They arrive at the location, AM and AF wander off. Suddenly scream. White couple and ABM run towards asian couple. AF almost fainted upon sight of a dead body. Purpose: show that AF is weak, incompetent.

WM ask if they are alright. AM SCREAMS at the friendly aussies and insults them for no reason. Purpose: to show that AM is unreasonable, toxic, violent, agressive, bossy, arrogant and unfriendly.

WW our herione, unlike our AF, even touches the corpse and picks up the phone. Purpose: show WW are brave. Scared of nothing.

They argue a little and says that they need to look for survivors. To which AM objects hard. Purpose: show AM is alien, without compassion, egoistic, only thinks of himself, cowardly, unreasonable.

They overrule AM. To which AM reacts VIOLENTLY. I kid you not. He stomps on the ground, throws the phone or pushes the phone HARD into WM chests and screams ""my charter my rules"" and walks away angrily. Purpose: show AM is agressive and violent and unreasonable and snobby. Nobody reacts like this in real life. A similar push in a bar will result in a fight. This wasnt a shove. This was almost a punch to the chest.

By now, Im already disgusted with the portrayal of asians in this movie.

So WM brushes it off, how? In reality this results in a fight in a bar. But ofc the script says he doesnt react to it because purpose: show WM is compassionate, reasonable, not violent, not agressive. The total opposite of AM.

So fast forward, the plane sinks. They all escape to the raft. Everyone gets on board. Guess what. AM refuses. He is literally in the water hanging on the sinking plane and refusing to get on the raft. Everyone screaming at him to get on board and AM screaming back he aint getting on the raft with a shark beneath them.

Who behaves like this? Noone. But think about the purpose. The purpose is to show, AM are unreasonable. Dont do logic, are cowardly, cant be reasoned with and lack skill.

He jumps onto the raft. He argues with WM. WM lectures AM by showing him he knows nothing, he himself is the marine biologist and the great knowledgable warrior. Purpose: to put AM in his place. Dont go too far or you will get slapped down.

Fast forward.

AM drinks from bottle. The bottle is empty. Throws it right into the ocean. Doesnt give a fuck. WM sees the bottle, picks it up again. Why is this scene even in the movie? It makes no gotdamned sense? Purpose: to show Asians are toxic and dont care about the environment. That asians pollute the oceans and the earth. While the WM cleans everything up.

They see something in the water. AM flips out. Starts hitting the water with the peddle randomly closeby. Everyone mocks the AM saying its just dolphins. Even AF turns on AM. AM flips. AF finds an excuse and everyone calms down. What kind of moronic scene is this. Purpose: to show AM has no skill, no competence, cowardly, knows nothing.

They row a little and AF faints or sleeps or whatever and drops the peddle. Ofc nobody notices it until they are an ends away. They all flip. What now. Brave WW jumps into the water and swims towards it and takes it back while theres a big shark down there. Purpose: AF is incompetent, weak, has no skills. Compared to AF, WW is brave, scared of nothing, can swim past a shark, is fearless and succeeds.

It starts to rain, the ladies are urged to put some clothes on. While ABG and AM are rowing. Suddenly ABG turns around and wants to physically help the AF...to which AM explodes in anger and pushes ABG down with condenscending remarks. ABG stands up and confronts bullying AM. AM physically assaults and pushes ABG man off the raft into the water.

Purpose: show AM is overjealous, violent, agressive, unreasonable.

At this point, I stop watching. Disgusting piece of propaganda. Disgusting piece of movie. This is how australia sees itself.",18,2021-05-26 06:11:18,aznidentity,t3_nl9pz1,t3_nl9pz1,gzhfydc,"0"

u/findingjapanesemusic,"I think my other comment got removed by automoderator. I'll PM it over. It was a reply to your other comment.

No... I definitely talk and interact with arabs/turks more than I watch dramas. I dont/haven't watch any turk drama except ertugrul

My girl is turkish/arab mixed (some French). Her family is spread out around the middle east and North Africa. She's mainly arab culturally since she didnt grow up in Turkey even though she and her family are part turkish. She looks spanish, and is considered just a ""dark-haired white girl"" or ""spanish girl"" in the USA.... defintiely not considered a ""terrorist"". This is even though she can tan pretty dark during the summer if she wants to (but her skin is mostly a light bronze slightly whitish color)

Her family members range from slightly african looking to being blonde haired green eyed, from very dark skin to very light skin completely european looking....

No, Arabs do not look mostly brown..... Arabs are not really a race... there are very ""African blood"" arabs, the ""bedouin tribe"" arabs who generally have darker skin as you said and dark hair, and then the many arabs who are mixed with Europeans or spanish or italian or mediterranean people or berbers.... many of whom would be considered white in the USA. 

In the USA and western countries like Canada, or australia...... skin color is not what determines if somebody is white. People with medium or light skin color and pointy nose/big eyes are all considered ""white"". Basically all caucasoids are considered ""white"". For example the ""turkish"" reporter Cenk Uyghur of The Young Turks who is super racist towards Chinese people, he is an ""American Turk"", but he just is considered ""white"" in the USA.

 You live in Turkey, right? Or europe? I think your frame of reference is narrow and not what we are talking about here (we talk about  the racial hierarchies of the entire world, mostly influenced by the west). 

Have you ever traveled all around the arab world? Lots of Egyptians look straight up european, same with lebanese, same with many berbers or other arabs in Algeria or Morocco or tunisia.... Yes many many look ""unmistakably brown"" or maybe even look like north Indians, and are considered non-white, but at least 50% would be considered white-latino or mixed spanish-white or southern european white in the West (USA, Canada, Australia, etc)

Your frame of reference must only be the EU, you probably only know of racial dynamics in the EU, where, yes they hate Muslims, but I know so many tunisian and moroccan and egyptians who live in the EU who look just italian or even pass as dark haired french, and they dont dress ""Muslim"" at all and can mostly blend in, and only if they mention they are Muslim or are from another country... only then do they get discriminated... otherwise they are considered just ""white""... and if they came to the USA, nobody could tell the difference....... and I dont think light skinned east asian men like me are treated favourably at all in the EU or anywhere in the world. Every race talks shit and lies about us having ""small dicks"" even if guys like me are above average dick size......

 I've met many europeans who came to the USA to work and they are super racist towards east asian men.

"" Take a look at white nationalost subs and their biggest obsession is with Muslims and browns, then black people.""

This is only in Europe and only because East Asian and SE Asian women are considered easy for them and they think they already conquered our race. And only because Musim/brown women are mostly loyal to their own men, and because Turk/Arab/Muslim/Black men are aggressive in fucking white girls.

Lots of turk guys look like this right?

https://www.deviantart.com/assyrianic/art/Average-Mesopotamian-Face-197817682

I can tell immediately they are not european or ""white"" because I have been around a lot of arabs and turks, but the thing is in the USA, you guys are just considered ""caucasoid"" and as long as you dont mention you are Muslim, you do just fine in society - many many white latinos and white south americans look just like you guys and have pretty much all privileges of white guys, especially if your name doesnt sound too foreign.

Really, if you are not very tan and you have european features, try changing your name to an american name. I highly doubt most Americans or europeans would think you are middle easterner ""terrorist"" unless you have a very very ""classical persian/arab"" phenotype. They would think you are a descendant of a SE european or Italian or Spanish immigrant, but still ""white""

What they hate is Islam, they don't hate your race. They hate our race and black people.

Lots of turkish or arab women look like this, which is considered just some kind of ""ethnic"" SE European white or spanish or Italian in the USA or Canada.

I am not trying to say you guys dont face discrimination or something.

****And I wanna make clear I completely stand by you and I am against anti-middle eastern anti-turkish discrimination and other bullshit. I am just pointing out that racially you guys are very close to whites, and that is also why some of you guys and arab guys unfortunately become ""white supremacists"" if you were raised in the west or are part of the christian community, even if racially and historically, whites have been terrible to you guys as a group.

 I'm also just pointing out that you guys as a group are definitely ""caucasoid"" and are accepted by many whites if they dont know you are Muslim (and in your case you are not Muslim, so whites would have no problem with you and would be very welcoming of you also because you are Christian).

We Mongol or Chinese-looking east asians are considered aliens by Americans and white people in Europe, and truthfully we look completely different from caucasoids.

In the west and geopolitical world stage, there are three main races in race war - caucasoids (led by the western world), blacks, and chinese-looking asians.

Turks and arabs are a subgroup of caucasoids that the western world hates mainly because of religion, so they bully and bomb you guys, but their beef with you is mainly religion and continuation of crusades... not about race it is your ancestral cultures, languages, etc they hate, not your race. 

They don't hate you guys racially. They are very accepting of christian lebanese or christian turks.

This is why I say your hierarchy is wrong. East Asian men like Chinese Mongol Japanese are very much hated especially in the west and considered ""effeminate"" or ""losers"" or ""small dick"" even when scientifically we don't have small dicks, we aren't losers, and we aren't effeminate. But this is propaganda and race warfare. 
And so this is why East/SE Asian men are at the very bottom of the racial hierarchy (but East/SE Asian women are considered almost as close as white women)",1,2021-06-24 17:33:07,aznidentity,t3_o5e6mk,t1_h2thwdn,h2wosic,"0"

u/13guccichanclas13,"I see a lot of similarities between Asians who grew up in Asian enclaves and Asians who grew up in POC communities.  Both tend to be way more proud of being Asian, they're way more open to people of their own race, they usually have a preference for their own race, they're way more confident in their own skin.  All of the Asian women I've known who had a preference for Asian men were ABGs from Asian enclaves and POC neighborhoods.  The proudest Asians I've seen have always been the ones from Asian enclaves and POC neighborhoods.  I love the trend I'm noticing with Gen Z Asians, the little jade Buddha pendants.  I love how protective of it they are too.  I remember talking to an Asian girl on Tinder who said she hates seeing non Asians wearing them because she knows they have no connection to Buddhism and are just using it as an aesthetic.

Asians from white neighborhoods are different.  No offense to the Asians who grew up with whites here, but a lot of them are kinda fucked in the head.  They have a lot of internalized racism, they likely grew up with identity issues, they usually allow themselves to be walked all over, especially if the person walking all over them is white, and their involvement in Asian culture tends to be surface level and performative.  Yeah, boba is good but your culture is deeper than that.

I think the funniest shit I’ve ever seen is when I was out in a bar in Ohio with my Chinese ex-girlfriend (ABG, one of those “sexy” types), and some beta white boy came over and just stood there making loud, weird noises.  Like he expected her to just suddenly magnetically gravitate towards him or something because of his strange cracker mating calls (a lot of whites dudes in the Midwest got hella racist/salty when she used to reject them).  Him and his friends got really surprised when I suddenly got in their faces and asked for a lighter, like I was just supposed to sit there and stay quiet (although out there, a lot of Asians have basically been beaten into being silent).

Usually, “alpha” types of any race generally only care about their own, so it’s always the weird, awkward, maladaptive ones (which make up the majority) that behave this way.  I recall reading an old article on here about how a bunch of lower-class white US GIs used to marry camptown prostitutes in Korea, who treated them better (since they had no choice!), since they would never be eligible for a “good marriage” to a white girl back home.

u/[deleted],"What you are saying is absolutely true, but keep in mind that Asians are sort of separated by social groups. The ABGs generally do hang out in Asian raver, ABB (Asian guy with fade / blonde hair / earring) groups, where white guys are rare or uncommon. Thus for the best looking Asian girls, you are competing against the top looking Asian men.

Where the most competition takes place for us Asian guys I think is the middle tier. I have noticed that WMAF occurs more commonly with average / nerdy / plain girls that are trying to date up, and those girls usually hold poor or negative stereotypes of Asian guys. 

But I feel in that bracket, if Asian guys put in more effort in appearance and working out, they could improve their outcomes with women a lot.",3,2021-09-20 14:55:53,aznidentity,t3_prfatb,t1_hdlfjtq,hdlik1c,"0"

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"There is bit of a divide between Asians that recently immigrated to the US and those born in America, that is true any where in the states. BUT, on the west coast “Asian America” is more defined uniquely and apart from white culture. (Side note: Latinos have the most dominant culture out in California and they even outnumber the white population here). Asian America on the west coast and particularly in California has always had stronger roots and stronger identity to being Asian.  It wasn’t just neighborhoods in major cities, but Asians had enclave cities all over California. Daly City, San Jose, Arcadia, Westminister, Alhambra, Long Beach, Hayward, Vallejo, Millbrae, Milpitas, San Gabriel, and the list goes on and on for Asian dominated cities. Alot of the major Asian gangs also started in California and defined the aesthetic for Asian America(the whole ABG aesthetic/ “Kevin Nguyen”). The early Asian party rave scene started in California. The Asian fraternity/sorority scene in America started in California. Growing up in an enclave on the west coast, you would definitely be looked at as the odd one out if you wanted to be white or acted “white washed” if you were in an Asian enclave. Me and my peers also had a lot of older Asians to look at as role models. Older Asians that were athletes, scholars, “popular kids”, artists, gang members, car enthusiasts, skaters, gym rats, party goers or anything a younger person would admire an older person for. Certain cities and certain districts, it wouldn’t be abnormal to have public schools that were over 50% Asian. And I’m talking big schools too of 1,000-2,000 students.

There was just so much culture to draw from that preceded you growing up as an Asian American on the west coast/from California, you didn’t need to look anywhere else.",2,2021-09-24 23:49:08,aznidentity,t3_pufnh8,t1_he4ki60,he5mz74,"0"

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"A lot of the “white liberalism woke” Asians tried to cancel these guys for thirst trapping all the time. They said these guys were fetishizing themselves because they started a trend called “Pick Your Asian”. They also put #kpop and #asianboy in the description, for whatever that’s worth. I’ve never seen the same energy from the same woke crowd for all the years I’ve seen Asian girls thirst trap and clout chase using their “Asian ness” in the process. I’ve seen wayy further extremes of aspiring social media famous Asian girls sexualizing themselves and fetishizing their Asian ness. And this was for years upon years. It’s how the term ABG got so saturated and eventually got used to describe Asian women who wear a modern western style of makeup. It brought “ABGs” to the mainstream.

There’s pages on IG with hundreds of thousands(some millions) of followers where they feature these kinds of girls so they get more followers a lot of times with consent from the very girls. And a lot even ask to get featured for more clout. Example would be something like this https://instagram.com/realestasiangirls?utm_medium=copy_link . A lot of these girls use their social media followings to promote an Onlyfans too. And look, I’ve said this before, I HAVE NO REAL PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THIS. Make your money. Open doors for yourself. Get your clout. BUT I have also never seen anyone from the Asian White Liberalism follower camp try to cancel these girls while trying to cancel the “Pick Your Asian” Asian guys.

If you are looking for proud middle/uuper middle class Asians Americans go to the San Gabriel valley cities. This is where the original azn pride originated back in the early 2000's

If you are looking for clueless asian American girls that think they are white and don't realize they don't get treated as such, go to orange county (outside of little Saigon) or to find church asian

If you want a street smart southeast asian girl who isn't afraid of confrontation aka ABG, go to long beach. 

If you want third generation ones, go to Torrance.

Downtown lA/the San Fernando valley for whitewashed asian girls (compete with the white guys for one) 

If you want a creative asian girl type, go to the beach cities like Santa Monica. 

Westside LA for a social climber type asian girl. Don't try unless u r rich+ hot. 

San Diego area if you want a more easy going asian girl, especially if you prefer fillipinas.

Bro, you're confusing having low standards with different beauty standards. These “beautiful” slavic women you trip and wet your pants over won’t be worth a second look here in Australia. Here’s an analogy - White men go for the ugliest Asian women and think they’ve earned themselves the most beautiful woman in the world.

Ok so you are going to walk back on your statement about Asian men finding Slavic women the most beautiful in the world? I clearly told you to stop with your generalisations and try enough of trying to speak behalf of all of us. It’s embarrassing. Someone else has already pointed out the reason AMWF is bigger than WMAF in Russia. Even among Asian women that White Worship, Russian men are not an option. You never hear Asian women fawning over Russian men as they consider that to be dating down. If it’s not Anglo then it’s French, Italian or something like that. However, since men tend to date down, third world Slavics happen to be the best trophies for the White Worshippers. I agree with this though. For some reason, Korean women do not seem to like Korean men although Asian women in general do. Just look at China, Japan and any SEA country. They are obsessed with Korean men.

They just want to fuel an EA vs SEA divide(that is centered around “privelege”) that didn’t exist as much in the prior generations where the term ABG and the culture surrounding it came from. They just want to gatekeep and come up with new meanings for something that came from an era that they aren’t from.

Yes there were beefs between EA and SEA gangs as there were beef between EA and other EA gangs and SEA and other SEA gangs. There were even a lot of EA gangs that had SEA members and some even vice versa. It wasn’t as cut and dry as Gen-Z Asians perceive it to be. A lot of EA and SEA groups socioeconomically were more aligned with one another during these times.

Adding to this other comment I made is that the mass immigration from Korea and China to America was as refugees from the Korean War and Cultural Revolution. Both countries were 3rd world countries and people were starving to death.

As for EA gangs, like Chinese gangs, they were some of the most established players in this world during the 70s-2000s, but most got swept by the FBI during the late 90s-early 2000s due to being involved in organized crime with the Triads and other Asian gangs in Asia. During this time period, all organized crime gangs were taken down by the FBI(Italian mafia on the East coast for example). When it came to the Chinese organized crime gangs, they all slowly converted to being more and more underground. Still trafficking drugs and guns but not being involved in as much violent crime to make it less hot. Technology and surveillance has only gotten more advanced since then and being involved in violent crime only gets in the way of money. Chinese gangs also have stayed alive due to being privileged enough to have a large network domestically and internationally. But circling back to the whole ABG thing, yes East Asian gangs had ABGs rolling with them. There were a lot of Chinese and Korean ABGs in the 80s/90s/2000s. A lot were the earliest “famous ABGs” through the import modeling scene. These models were pretty evenly EA and SEA.

Gen Z just saturated tf out of that word because of social media and Asian social scenes like Asian fraternities/sororities and Asian nightlife scenes that commercialized it(at least within the Asian community). Now Asians outside of enclaves on the west coast can be put on to it. You don’t even need to grow up around Asians to be hip to it or borrow from it. But this whole notion that ABGs can’t be EA or that it was a discriminatory word from EAs towards SEAs is dumb. There were hella EA ABGs in the 80s/90s/2000s.

Hey, at least they're not trying to shoe-horn in a Tom Holland or random white guy as they did in Asian movies in the past.

There's an Alejandro Akara mentioned. Will they try to pass him off as Asian with that last name? He's Mexican, but I guess that's appropriate enough with this taking place in the OC.

Ross Butler's in that, a hapa. He's like a junior Henry Golding, lol. But that film also has Nico Hiraga, a full Asian. And again, at least they're not shoehorning in white guys as they did in the past.

Funny that Hollywood is finally mining classic Asian American narratives like ABGs and Love Boat for material. I wonder if it's because Asians have succeeded financially, and so now we're cool and people want to know out formative experiences.

I don't think it's the same dynamic with black films, where people like Tyler Perry have enough of a following from the 10% of America that is black. Asian Americans are half that, and don't consume pop culture in the same way that black Americans do.

And films like these are unlikely targeted for the overseas market, as Awkwafina's ""The Farewell"" shows, overseas Asians aren't interested in Asian America.",3,2022-07-03 14:39:43,aznidentity,t3_vq8unf,t3_vq8unf,iep9awe,"0"

Like in NSW it was like 3 months on end lol. Victoria had 5 months total lockdown as well

I'm willing to bet the rest of the sub here dont actually live in Australia which is ok but yes there is proper hardblown racism here and there, subtle racism such as not being greeted at the cashier when you buy something or pay for petrol (interestingly I am not greeted by other immigrants working at the cashier like Middle Eastern looking types rather than ""white"" people and I am born here so there's no accent, its really based on my outwards appearance alone). But living in Sydney its more of the subtle racism type as the city itself has a lot of immigrant enclave suburbs if you were actual hardblown racist you would move to the country I reckon. I dont have a problem with living here as is and compared to my heritage countries of course you're always accepted in public without judgement but once I do put on a stereotypical aussie accent the slightly racist types leave you alone and go oh you are local I thought you came here recently. I feel like racism itself stems from lack of understanding of a culture based on appearance and cultural traits/stereotypes/values. Especially because outwards I look quite ""fob"" because I don't have the stereotypical tanned ABG look and wear glasses half the time. 

In Sydney we have massive Asian festivals like Moon Festivals celebrated in Cabramatta and Eid/Ramadan Night Market and such so its not as racist as you make it seem like Sydney or Melbourne is 90% white and the asians are like 2% and its like the 1980s when you're the only Asian kid at school. Its actually the opposite in the selective schools, the school population is 90% Asian heritage as it is an academic school. But yes our city used to have heaps of foreign investors buying up property including a lot of mainland Chinese but due to 2020 lockdowns and the hardline policy of no visitors and no exits for 2 years without a good excuse a lot of the mainland Chinese with strong links to China financially or living there went back during that time because you cant complete the census overseas. If you left to move overseas during those 2 years you couldnt just randomly come back for a holiday unless you were a Permanent Resident or Citizen intending to stay put for 2 years.

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"Maybe cause some of them actually do have ties to Asian gangs or family in them? When Asian gangs were even more prominent in the 90s-early 2010s, there was a lot of overlap between Asian gangs and the Asian fraternity/sorority scene. It’s been this way since the Asian Greek scene was started. Im speaking for California of course which is the origin of Asian Greek life. A lot of Asian girls that hung out with Asian gang members in middle school/Highschool would end up at a state college and the natural progression for them was joining some Asian sorority. A lot of the smarter Asian gang members(yes there are a good handful of school smart Asian gang members, take the founders of Asian Boys the Mercado Brothers as an example) that did decent/well in Highschool ended up at some university and would naturally join Asian frats. It’s not to say all Asian guys who join Asian frats are affiliated with that life because there are a good amount that aren’t and are squares. But who do you think is their plug? They got frat bros slangin. A lot of the whole ABG/Kevin Nguyen look and lifestyle got popularized outside of gangs and imported through the Asian Greek life scene. It’s one of the big factors along with social media. And these Asians are definitely unique from black or Latino street gang culture. Maybe outside looking in, someone may confuse it. But unique aspects are driving riced out JDM cars or in more modern times Beamers. Or having Asian inspired tattoos like dragons, Kois, foodogs, etc. Going to raves, which is not popular with the black community and in my observation is popular with Latinos NOT associated with the Latino gang culture. The type of jewelry, jade pendants with gold chains. Smoking cigarettes which is more of an Asian thing than any other race. The types of hair cuts Asians get are different.

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"And contrary to what Gen Z is claiming these days, all this stuff is rooted in BOTH East Asian AND Southeast Asian gangs from the 80s-2000s. Gen Z only recognizes Southeast Asian gangs these days for a multitude of reasons. Most East Asian gangs in every major American city was RICOd by the FBI in the late 90s-2000s for being involved with organized crime gangs like the Triads in Asia and that was starting to influence local government power(look in to SF politician Leland Yee for an example). The government will shut down those who threaten their power compared to street gangs who threaten other gang members and civilians. East Asian gangs are completely underground now and a lot of members are in jail or just grown too old and moved on with life. East Asian gangs didn’t immediately die out after the RICO but gradually did decades after. Another reason Gen-z only recognizes southeast asian gangs as the “prime” influence of the whole Asian American gang culture/lifestyle/aesthetic/etc is because they recognize that East Asian countries are the ones more economically prosperous these days and that’s becoming more congruent in East Asians today. For one, when East Asians(Chinese/Koreans) immigrated here in mass it was from the 70s-2000s. Koreans had the highest immigration post Korean War where Korea was a third world country and among the worlds poorest. Most Korean Americans are refugees from that or their parents/grandparents were. Also when Asian countries go from developing to first world, so does the immigration out slow down dramatically. When we look at China, the mass immigration to America happened during and after the the Cultural Revolution where the country was poverty and famine stricken. It was this way in China for decades, but in 2022 it looks completely different. My thing is the VAST majority of Chinese Americans arrived in the US as refugees from this era. A lot were peasants from the country side. A lot of their children formed and joined gangs that had ties to the Triads/14k Asian crime organizations that were based in American major city Chinatowns. Another reason I think Gen Z only recognizes South East Asian gangs as the sole influence is because in modern times you see South Asian gangster rappers as the ones in “popular” Asian American pop culture. But yeah this is a whole tangent I went on, but I just wanted to make the association to a conversation I see a lot now a days. East Asian gangs AND Southeast Asian gangs both played a part. But all in all, the Asian Greek life scene played a part in importing the Asian gang culture/lifestyle/look even if a lot of times now a days it’s a gentrified version of it. I blame social media for watering down the whole ABG/ABB thing too.

Edit: last thought, Asian Greek life is where a lot of East Asians and Southeast Asians got together and mixed/mingled.

u/IllllIllIllI,"There is a once famous saying from Henry Ford that you can have any colour of car you like so long as it is black.  
The equivalent is applied to Asian-Australian dudes in Australia. It seems you can date any race you want as long as you like as long as she is Asian. It is seen as disturbing the status quo if you don't date Asian much like not choosing a black coloured paint when buying a Ford motor vehicle back then.  
Apparently Asian women dating out disturbs the status quo far lesser than an Asiuan guy dating out in Australia.  
Same logic applies to Love Island hence why you will never see a handsome Asian guy in Love Island Australia for at least 100 years.  


Australia still has a significant amount of the jobs for the boys economy but Australian television and media in general have some of the most blatant and rampant nepotism still alive out of other industries in Australia once you speak to some former interns and junior staff. Then there is the issue of declining press freedom which is a different topic altogether.  
  
The glass ceiling in Australia for Asian men particularly straight Asian men is highly prevalent.  
East Asians in the club scene will be at most be a photographer or DJ at second rate clubs or just a promoter in clubs of a mostly Asian clientele particularly ABGs and ABBs.  
  
I am not a huge fan of politics but an East Asian dude can at most make it in federal parliament if he has an ironclad will to withstand the countless onslaught of accusations that he is some agent of the Chinese Communist Party even if he wants nothing to do with them nor have anything to do with them.  
No worries that Penny Wong made it as a foreign minister as Asian women fit better the Australian narrative than Asian dudes.  
  
Why Asian dudes keep coming to Australia unless they are somehow able to make a quick buck in certain areas in Australia such as being a doctor in a rural place to avoid the higher job competition for doctors in cities or join in on the unhealthy obsession with local real estate is beyond me.

u/jacarabit,"&gt;Sure, I had Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma when I was 28 lol. Life was awesome back then in hindsight. I was working my first salaried job as a Financial Analyst after years of IT Contract and Consulting. I had and still have a close friend network, and an attractive white girlfriend definitely out of my league except for one thing... she had epilepsy, so for what other people consider red flags, it was my gain. Things were good, besides some old drama of bullying and jokes from high school, college for looking like a ProZD kinda guy until I started manning up around 21.  
&gt;  
&gt;The tumor was the size of a grapefruit. I was coughing for a year with coworkers commenting on how I should get the cough checked... which I eventually did, and found out through an x-ray that I had cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, after chemo, radiation therapy, and 2 biopsies. I felt like myself again... except for the double chin. There was endless feelings of gratitude from what I experienced, including a supportive girlfriend who stayed with me when I looked like an incel. The problem is, I've always wanted better; in life situations, money, status. That's my problem. I asked her to move in with me (2 years relationship), she didn't want to be a burden, and enjoyed freedom (given her disability, and pragmatism, are smart choices in hindsight), and I started a new journey thinking If I act like the same chad I was before cancer, things would be alright.  
&gt;  
&gt;It didn't. I'd run 5ks regularly, 10ks regularly, doing 100 pullups, 200 pushups, 300 squats... with the dawning horror I was now a fat faced asian man and all these functional movements choked and hurt when I did them. And the hilarious thing to this was, there was nothing wrong with me personality wise. Plenty of women still gave me their time... just the fat and ugly ones. I couldn't get off my high horse and just accept the cards I've been dealt with. Psychologically, I couldn't accept myself for this medical situation beyond my control. I kept enough sanity to be good to friends, maintain a career, exercise... but the longer there was no progress, I was losing it.  
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, this surgery worked. I can be the man I used to be,  and work on things like gratitude, such as the fact I've been in remission for 4 years, be kinder to myself and help others.  
&gt;  
&gt;This CABG procedure may last 5 years, it may last 10 or more. It could need medical intervention and have to be restented or opened. I can probably survive 3 of these if I lived an ascetic life eating like a japanese person, with the exercise as well. In any case I don't fear death.

I admittedly didn’t get some the jokes till I thought more about it after.  

I realize why I didn’t get it.  I don’t really hang out with younger generation Asians and kind of aged out of that crowd.  

There’s little jokes here and there only Asian people would get.  Like Hsu’s character was an ABG who’s trying to hide that fact from her good looking Asian fiancé.  But there was enough Asian jokes in there that I got that kept me entertained.  

Spoilers:

I also liked how the main character, an Asian adoptee was called out throughout for being white washed. The other women call her out on it several times.  
She ends up having a threesome with Chris Pang and a good looking Indian guy. 

I like the twist of her actually being half Korean, her mom.  Her going back to Korea and meeting her mom’s current husband played by Dae Kim gave the feels. 

It’s good to see different Asian ethnicities hanging together.  

I took a good looking white girl to see this and although she didn’t get a lot of the jokes, she drooled over the sexy, shirtless, Asian men in the movie.  White men are a non factor.

Exactly. Much of this depends on the history of the immigration. The experience of immigrants who moved to the West looking for jobs in academia or the tech sector will fundamentally differ from that of immigrants who had to move because they were affiliated with the losing side of a war. The children of the former group have little incentive to rock the boat; they can keep what they have by sticking to what their parents have done. Things have clearly not worked out for war refugees, and it is no surprise that their children are more rebellious against the established order.

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"In the 90s and 2000s some of the biggest Asian gangs in Southern California were Chinese. Look into Wah Ching. They had a huge presence in Sang Gabriel Valley. Most of the Chinese prior to the 2000s were Cantonese. Not coincidentally the GDP per capita of China was lower than that of Southeast Asian countries, prior to the mid 2000s. A majority of Chinese Americans settled in America from the 70s-2000s. These new Chinese immigrants you see come from a post economic boom China, but they are the minority.

I think a lot of people get the misconception that the whole Azn Pryde, abg stuff only came from southeast Asians when it was just as much from Chinese and some Koreans even(look into the Korean gangs in Southern California where these Koreans came from a post Korean War South Korea where their home country was even poorer than most African countries).

And the reason you don’t see Chinese gangs in America out and about these days is because they went underground and are sticking more strictly to hustling. Wah Ching was derived from Northern Californias Chinese organized gangs and those gangs started to get RICOd by the feds for being involved in organized crime. They went underground first and then Southern California Chinese gangs eventually did the same. Even Vietnamese gangs in Southern California have seem to switched to mostly hustling these days.

u/ForestLight1,"You need to take into consideration **Asian American culture** vs. Asian culture in the US. Maybe specifically Asian American culture is more common in places where there are more ABCs, 2nd to 3rd gen or more. That's more like NYC, LA, and Bay Area. 

Like MOCA (Museum of Chinese Americans), for example - that seems completely ABC, including adoptees, and it's not immigrant or fobby. The stereotypical old Chinese immigrant granny is completely far from that space, as far as a non-Asian is. 

SGV (San Gabriel Valley) has a specifically Asian American culture, full of boba, ABGs, EDM(?), UCs, and good times, and varies according to age. 

There are lots of Asian/Chinese foods and events that's more fobby, like fobby restaurants, that ABCs won't touch. **But many ABCs are very into Asian American culture vs. fobby Asian culture.** Fung Bros. is a good example of this - 99 Ranch was cool, but they'll probably never step foot in a fobby classic mom-and-pop grocery. Chairman Bao hip food truck is good, but they'll never step foot in a fobby little dim sum place, with roasted pigs hanging about. 

A classic Lunar New Year celebration in any city might be too fobby, cliched, or meant-for-non-Asians, and ABCs are unlikely to go there. Yet they're still in touch with their Asian American side, and gladly and enthusiastically go to anything that Asian Americans like. Millenial ABCs might REALLY like Studio Ghibli, like Spirited Away, and that's very Asian American because it's popular in America, but has ties to Asia. Yet most ABCs will have no idea of today's Mando-pop, because that's unknown outside of Sinosphere countries, and looked down upon, too. 

ABCs who are very into Asian American culture, like Fung Bros, often don't hit any of your points, because you're talking about ABCs who appreciate or are exposed to more Asia Asian or fobby culture, in a good way. Obviously Fung Bros and most ABCs haven't had an opportunity to go ""back"" to their parents' native lands every summer, or speak/read Chinese at near-native level. Fung Bros are like so many ABCs in speaking a conversational elementary-school level, though they seem to pronounce it well, and know both Mando and Canto, since their parents are from Mainland and HK. 

ABCs often look down on other Chinese and other ABCs if it doesn't meet their level of ABC. ABCs who are whitewashed (this is a very broad term) or into specifically Asian American culture will look down on more Chinese people than the relatively fewer ABCs who have good, positive exposure to more fobby/immigrant/Asia Asian culture.",1,2023-08-19 19:40:25,aznidentity,t3_15qnewe,t1_jw5hlc6,jwwfpj8,"0"
u/Th3G0ldStandard,"I don’t think this is common place at all. There are a bunch of simultaneous trends and niches going on in China that young people are grabbing on to. I’ve also seen that there’s a trend of younger Chinese women using the Asian American ABG style. It’s all novelty and interesting to them.

This kind of reminds me of how Japan has been over the past 30-50 years. You’ll see pockets of niches from around the world being enjoyed and gone into by local Japanese. Anywhere from Southern California Chicano/Cholo culture to Americana to Cowboys to skateboarding to hip hop to old school Chinese martial arts films(creator of Dragon Ball was a nerd for this and drew inspiration for the series from this and Chinese culture). Literally any and every subculture has a pocket in Japan even if any single one isn’t a norm there. And they pay a good deal of respect to the source but at sometimes bring the culture even further. Look at the history of Japanese denim and the heights it is looked at today in that world.",1,2023-09-06 19:41:02,aznidentity,t3_16bi2pp,t3_16bi2pp,jzfaq86,"0"

Halfs never look fully white and tend to more like turks which doesnt fit the standard of western media of blondes. There are known half Japanese females like Sarah emi bridcutt, ai fairouz, lynn. But majority of beauty magazines still feature full asian women. Similiar story with the men.

This mentality only really only applies to old gen immigrants like those in bay area who are/had tiger parents who were so desperate to fit in.

u/Th3G0ldStandard,"This whole “East Asian vs South East Asian beef”, “jungle Asian” nonsense is a newer narrative strum up by younger Asians and Boba liberals. I’m from an Asian enclave where Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, and Vietnamese coexist fine. A lot of the times we are in the same friend groups, social groups at school, and in relationships with one another. We never even thought about the denominations or terms of “East Asian/Southeast Asian”. We came from the same socioeconomics in the 80s-2000s, usually immigrant parents from war, extreme poverty, or extreme famine. This notion that one was “oppressive and demeaning” to another is bizarre to me. Lots of these Gen-z Asian babies and Bobas don’t see past 10 years ago and don’t realize East Asian countries like China and South Korea were POORER than most Southeast Asian countries when it comes to per capita GDP just half a generation to one generation ago. That and the largest mass immigration  from those countries were during the years when they were poor. When economy stabilizes in an Asian country then immigration to the US drops off a cliff. It’s a reason why you never see recently immigranted Japanese in the US. Hell you rarely meet Japanese people in the US because of this due to their population aging out and no new immigration. 

I say all this to say that this whole EA vs SEA nonsense is just that, nonsense. And I’m a Southeast Asian person. These classifications aren’t even really used in Asia. If you’re Filipino you think you’re Filipino. If you’re Chinese, you think you’re Chinese. So on and so forth. The terms “East Asian”, “Southeast Asian” and even “Asian” is only ever though of about in the West. It’s a white man’s classification for us.

And if someone wants to debate me on how these terms differentiate levels of “privelege” between Asians there are tons of stats that disprove it completely. Korean Americans and Chinese Americans actually average less income than Vietnamese and Filipino Americans. Indian Americans sit at the top blowing EVERYONE about of the water. So among Asians it’s not really about skin color or being East Asian vs Southeast Asian like some of these younger folks try to make it about. You have East Asian groups like Taiwanese Americans that do exceptionally well and Southeast Asian American groups like Filipinos and Vietnamese that do well. You have East Asian groups like Mongolians that don’t succeed to the same degree as well as Southeast Asian groups like Burmese Americans that similarly don’t succeed to the same degree. Accessibility to socioeconomic mobility has a bigger correlation to population size in the United States more than anything. Larger population means larger ethnic enclaves. That means an easier time integrating into life in the west and more opportunities provided to make a living. 

But yeah, not buying the whole “EA vs SEA” thing in the diaspora. I seen younger Asians try to say “ABG” was used as a damn slur to Southeast Asian girls 😂😂. Do these Asians not realize there were tons of East Asian ABGs (as well as Southeast Asian) in the 90s-2000s? This whole thing came from Southern California and East Asian gangs were some of the biggest and most established in that era like Wah Ching.",26,2023-11-04 00:29:55,aznidentity,t3_17n5qtf,t3_17n5qtf,k7q758h,"0"
u/DnB925Art,"It's funny that Thailand which is also greatly influenced with Chinese culture is a cannabis legal country in Asia. Also you're pretty ignorant of the history of Cannabis in Chinese culture. Cannabis originated from Western China and Central Asia and Chinese have been using Cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes since the first BC millennium

u/81dragons,"The word ""fob"" in your first sentence is a good example of Asian-American English. There are about a dozen slang words that a lot of Asian Americans know like ""ABG"" ""fob"" ""fobby"" ""banana"" ""twinkie"" ""coconut"" ""yappie"" ""ABC"" ""ABCD"" ""AZN"" .

With grammar, there are a few phrases that basically are borrowed with Chinese grammar or expressions like ""lose face"" ""long time no see"" ""no can do"" but those are mostly mainstream English now. 

About accents, this is a very interesting video that basically analyzed that even US-raised Asians will often show upward inflection or have different pronunciations of a-e-i vowels, the ah-o-uh vowels, or dropping t-k-d-g. There are examples from people like Andrew Yang who mostly sound native but don't sound ""white"". The examples are mostly Chinese Americans and Korean Americans though, and some were technically born abroad but moved to the US as kids. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxlT17TtBGQ",3,2023-11-23 05:06:29,aznidentity,t3_1811nwa,t3_1811nwa,kaehopd,"0"
u/shraaaamps,"I agree with lots of the points here but I don't think it takes into account recent trends or the adoption of trends in general. The Chinese adopted western trends especially during the period in between poverty and a rising wealthier class before their society had individuals within their population that could influence the masses. That's obviously changed a lot since. There's the resurgence of Chinese traditional clothing as an example, the hanfu trend. There is America core, a more western look, but it's literally like a persona/costume that the wearer takes on. There's even ABG core which is meant to emulate well ""Asian baby girls"" in the West. If you look on Xiaohongshu, the range of trends leans from white to black to chinese, etc. 

People will adopt what is popularised and cool at the time. Look at the influence of Kpop/kdramas in the west for example. Suddenly a rise of non Asian females that want to date asian guys. Non Asian girls wanting to look ""asian"". 

There will be even greater influence from East Asian countries in the west over the next decade/couple decades (SK, Japan, China, etc.), not just in terms of physical appearance but cultural norms and things too. It comes with globalisation and these asian countries are flexing their soft power. This is how cultural trends develop.",1,2023-11-30 21:56:15,aznidentity,t3_1873pa4,t1_kbgjhlp,kbgnzil,"0"

Blonde hair specifically is commonly seen as rebellious and many people dye their hair blonde due to this. They want to seem cool. It’s similar to why the “ABG” look is starting to become popular in china. It’s not always white worshipping but rather trendy. Not everything is so centered on white people.
