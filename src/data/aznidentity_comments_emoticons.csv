u/AsianBourne,"&gt; Same people who call Zhong Guo Ren as Chinese, Nihonjin as Japanese, Hanguel saram as Korean, instead of using their actual names.

They call Deutscher as German, Cymraeg as Welsh, and Ivrit as Hebrew too xD

It's basically have something to do with the linguistic properties. I believe that because the Portuguese called the Japanese Jippon, and the word evolves to Japan from that. Because what they do is they romanize those words, or maybe they change the alphabet, so it sounds natural for their own language. When the Portuguese introduce the word to other Europeans, they would pronounce it in different way. I think it's Portuguese who went to Japan, since they also went to many countries in Asia, not sure about this.

Korean on the other hand, call them ilbon, they are neighboring countries so the words would be closer if you analyze the vowel. nIhOn and IlbOn. Just like how Chinese call Koreans Han Guo Ren, and Japanese Ri Ben Ren (from the characters). Probably the word Korea comes from Goryeo or Koryo which was a dynasty back then, and maybe the Europeans came to Korea when they encountered the dynasty (I'm not sure).

I think the word Japan is from the Chinese pronounciation Ci Pan (Ri Ben) from Shanghainese dialect. Maybe European went to Shanghai first before Japan.

It's just like Sino-Korean vocabularies and Sino-Japanese vocabularies, you can trace the origin back to Chinese Dialects/Mandarin sometimes, but they change the pronounciation.

I am not an expert and don't know the technical stuff when it comes to Asian languages, but the process is pretty much like that. You can analyze the history, and how Europeans went to Japan, China and Korea, and analyze the original words in order to find the process how it works.",4,2016-05-06 17:51:27,aznidentity,t3_4i5ov5,t1_d2vbz5t,d2vejbi,"0"

Are the job opportunities there plentiful at least? It doesn't sound like it is if your friends are still working the same jobs since they were 18. 

That's another thing--Hawaii's great if you're looking for pretty Asian girls but the job opportunities there are bad from what I heard. North Cali probably has the best job opportunities (out of the bubble areas) but rent is expensive. South Cali has less jobs but cheaper rent. If you're looking to move asap though, I can help suggest some cheaper areas in North Cali that are as least ghetto as possible with heavy Asian populations (since I'm from north).

Everything got wrapped up in a neat little package, really.  

1. Gurley and his estate got their symbolic felony manslaughter conviction; to move forward with their wrongful death civil lawsuit.

2. LEOs and their police fraternal organizations got some more lenient legal precedence/sentencing for these types of homocides. Note that Judge Chun added 300 additional hours to Liang's community service. 

3. DA Johnson was probably promised something for lenient recommendation/cooperation. ??? I'm speculating it was in his self-interest to do so.  State Senator Johnson, you sandbagging SOB. XD

**The Man with the Iron Fists** (2012)

All kinds of wrong with this movie.

Russell Crowe is very problematic in this film. In one of his earliest scenes, he “saves” an Asian prostitute from a rotund Asian man, and kills him in the most bloody way possible. And no one cares, as he walks away with his girls, while making a Chinese-eating-dog joke (Lucy Liu laughs to this).

In another scene, while he is getting intimate with Lucy Liu, he tells a small Asian man, “What are you looking at, dirty little man?” **In another scene, several women help him don actual Yellow Face, with the eyes and all, as he says, “Me… rikey.”** To this, of course, all the girls laugh along as he spews Chinese.

Near the end, Crowe, whose character is British, kills a stereotypical semi-Fu Manchu (completely with white hair) and finishes off with a joke about Opium.

This is just over-the-top emasculating. Asian women in this film cannot resist the white/black man, and also talk shit about all the Asian men, who are depicted as immoral, misogynistic savages. They are also depicted as racists against RZA, calling him “blackie” (to perpetuate the Racist Asian myth).

The only Asian-male protagonist in this Asian-male-gorefest has a ponytail and constantly needs RZA’s help (emasculation). The main Asian-male antagonist is also given an unbearable shrill laugh.

RZA also plays up the myth of Asian-male misogyny as well, as Lucy Liu and her girls decide to rise up against the men, by her words, hold all the power, and kill them all.

And of course, as part of Hollywood tradition, there’s an in-joke about the Asian-male eye, as it is punched out of an Asian man’s head (see: Minority Report [2002], Blade Runner [1982], Kill Bill: Volume 1 [2003], Blindness [2008], Push [2009], Slow West [2015], Constantine [2005], Big Short [2015], Cars 2 [2011], TV shows like Sherlock, etc.).

**Black Dynamite** 2009

Features Asian male subservience, kkkucking, Fu Manchu, small-dick stereotype, violence against Asian men, a comedic scene with a dying Vietnamese boy with a “Chinese face” and “Chinese knees,” cultural appropriation, slurs directed at Asian men, Asian male disembodiment, anti-Asian male physiognomical phrenology (centering on facial protrusion and eye-shape), mocking of Asian languages, Asian male clumsiness, Asian male emasculation, Yellow Peril, Dr. Wu homages, Asian male cowardice (aka being yellow), etc. all portrayed unironically with zero Asian-male humanization.

**The main story is that Asian men are trying to make Black men's penises smaller at the behest of white men.** 

The film also asserts that Asian men do not even have the rights to their own representation, or even their own stereotypes. African-American creators here ‘wield’ their stereotypes in an ironic manner in a definite, pro-Black Power way, an exaggerated form of racial-pride as was seen in Tarantino’s Django Unchained (2012).

Black male representation on film is so fucking different than Asian male representation on film that what this film does is unacceptable. This film’s overall goal is to positively portray Black males (great!). Asian men, however, never having been portrayed positively on film, cannot be treated in this manner, especially on film. Here, Asian-male stereotypes are co-opted used to our detriment in an unironic, non-subversive way.

It’s a shame. Besides this Black-on-Yellow bullshit, I thought the film was absolute artistic and comedic genius.

u/ivanchangarsenal,"&gt; She's not a bananarang.

OP did not say he is.  He does not like that her first-choice sexual preference is for men who do not look like him, which is [totally valid](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/66oh1r/having_standards_do_not_commit_to_asian_girls_who).

&gt;
No clue what you mean by ""innocent"" tho, that there in itself makes YOU seem like the strange one.

""Innocent"" presumably means low sexual history and lower propensity to causal sex.  That is a valid criteria for a girlfriend. 

&gt;
She's an ABC so I doubt she knows many Chinese celebs. Asians tend to go for more of a ""wholesome"" look anyway, not exactly the obnoxious douche that westerners tend to go for, the culture that she grew up in.

Asian and Asian-American media is easily accessible.  The ABCs I know who prefer Asian guys all know of Godfrey Gao, Harry Shum, Siwon Choi, etc.  Let's not pretend that this is the 80s where you have to go down to your Chinatown VCD store just to access Asian media.

&gt;
She hasn't cheated on you, she hasn't done jack all and you look to the internet to give you advice on whether to break up or not? Duuuuuude.

She *has* done jack all - she showed by her actions that she does not really like OP that much, hence her lack of initiating hangouts and his subconsciously (correctly) telling him that she is not his first choice.  Prevention is better than the cure.  Dating a girl who [does not strongly prefer Asian males is a terrible idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/66oh1r/having_standards_do_not_commit_to_asian_girls_who/).

u/WarrioroftheSE,"&gt;I don't even know what a ""4chan rejects"" is, kid. Sounds like you hang out on platforms for fags. And still triggered I see. You're too sensitive for this.
C'mon this is pathetic. It doesn't even take much thinking. I've given you all the clues just put them together, kid. Is it really that much to ask.
Another essay. Stating basically the same stuff. Over and over again. How often are you going to do this. It's getting embarassing, kid.

3 ""kid"" this time... hmmm Im starting to wonder who really is the kid between us xD

&gt;See, this makes me realize you haven't put any thought into it. This is already over. Now think about WHY this thread was made, not about its CONTENT. You'll get there, I believe in you.

Yeah you're full of shit you got nothing XD

**""Even if Connor Macgregor calls himself the Irish Bruce Lee, worships Bruce Lee, eats like Bruce Lee, talks like Bruce Lee, fights like Bruce Lee and then get's his ass beat in no way affects Bruce Lee's legacy and reputation at all because he's an icon, his reputation is set in stone and Connor has nothing to do with Bruce Lee.""**

I'm sticking to that, call it repeating my response, it doesn;t really matter because it makes sense unlike your vague clues bullshit lmao

&gt;Work on your approach next time. You've only been making a fool of yourself today, with the hysterical attitute, exhibiting little mental capacity or social skill, and showcasing a new petty kind of dorkiness.

Ok

&gt; I get absolutely no progress with you, sad to see.

I mean you are full of shit, and im done being nice xD im going to be real, you got nothing, you try to sound smart but it's like the shit I see in /r/iamverysmart

you've ran around in circles talking about clues, or whatever bullshit like youre some kind of smart cookie but nah you're full of shit, you got nothing, you've dragged this on refusing to even tell me your pov straight up, you got me wasting my time over this nonsense that doesnt even matter, this doesn;t even further the cause of our movement but instead has divided us because you still resort to petty namecallings instead of being real with me outright, I said help an asian brother out let me understand your pov, but nah it's back to ""clues"" this and that like wtf? this shit doesn't even matter that much, its ok to admit you got nothing  and that you don't know shit instead of running around in circles, pretending you're so smart and soo metaaaa.

You absoultely are full of shit, you are reaching, even if Connor and 200 million people think he's Bruce Lee and goes out and gets massacred by a homeless man it won't affect Bruce Lee's legacy or reputation because Bruce Lee is a legend and Connor has nothing to do with him at all.",1,2017-08-29 06:19:44,aznidentity,t3_6wax7e,t1_dm91byu,dm9rjh6,"0"

u/WarrioroftheSE,"Thanks a lot man, I figured why the hell not sacrifice my afternoon and actually talk to them about these issues.

&gt;I believe for /r/philippines, the mod team and majority of the browsers are pinoys. I see most of them know tagalog, so probably pinoy. You know few to none white sexpats would ever learn it. I think the head mod is pinoy, so I think there shouldn't be that many white mods on there.

Yeah they do know a lot of tagalog, and apparently at least 2 confirmed white men lurk there too, the first one  was the one I got a reply from and the 2nd was from this [lovely gentleman](https://i.imgur.com/AdTtm5P.jpg) Haven't gotten anything back so I guess my reply got through to him? xD

&gt;My past attempts at connecting with them wasn't that successful.

That was actually my 2nd post my first post was an artwork about Lapu Lapu titled  Where is Lapu Lapu : https://pre00.deviantart.net/b01c/th/pre/i/2012/249/2/7/where_is_lapu_lapu_by_frechstudios-d5dtqjs.jpg

""Where is Lapu Lapu?"", Mixed Media on Canvas, 36x60""

I have been painting Native Americans and learning about their culture which has been great but there was a void in me wondering ""who am I?"" So I began a study about a month and a half ago reading about my own background: the Philippines. 

I was enchanted by the stories of Lapu Lapu and his fight to resist colonialism and Western Invaders. Yet, the more researching I did, the more tragic things became. 

Instead of finding videos on youtube or stories online about the ""Pearl of the Orient"" all I found were stories, forums and videos about Western pedophiles visiting the Philippines for sex. Sitting there reading these things made me very upset and left me asking ""where is Lapu Lapu?""

But apparently Lapu Lapu is not a filipino hero but a selfish prick and that our FIlipino identity lies on the mestizos and spanish from the 19th century.

My second attempt was posting that thread as a reaction to the responses I got from my first post.

&gt;I think reaction towards you was an improvement than what I have faced before. 

I was optimistic, but yeah I guess it could have been worse :)

&gt;We should be doing a lot more outreach with them.

help European labor) praised the victory of the Exclusion
Act by saying that now the task for trade unionists was to
finish the job - by eliminating all Chinese left in the U.S
within the year!(36)
The settler propaganda kept emphasizing how
pure, honest Euiopeans had no choice but "" defend ""
themselves against the dark plots of the Chinese. Wanting
to seize ( "" annex "" ) Chinese jobs and small businesses,
European immigrants kept shouting that they were only
"" defending "" themselves against the vicious Chinese who
were trying to steal the white man's jobs! And in case any
European worker had second thoughts about the coming
lynch mob, a constant ideological bombardment surround -
ed him by trade union and "" socialist "" leaders, bourgeois
journalists, university professors and religious figures,
politicians of all parties, and so on. Having decided to
"" annex "" the fruits of the Chinese development of the Nor -
thwest, the unusal settler propaganda about "" defending ""
themselves was put forth.
Nor was Euro - Amerikan racial - sexual hate pro -
paganda neglected, just as bizarre and perverted as it is
about Afrikans. **In 1876, for example, the New York
Tzmes published an alleged true interview with the Chinese
operator of a local opium den. The story has the reporter
asking the "" Chinaman "" about the "" handsome but
squalidly dressed young white girl "" he sees in the opium
den. The "" Chinaman "" allegedly answers: "" Oh, hard time
in New York. Young girl hungry. Plenty come here.
Chinaman always have something to eat, and he like young
white girl, He! He! ""** A woman's magazine warned their
readers to never leave little white girls alone with Chinese
servants. The settler public was solemnly alerted that the
Chinese plot was to steal white workers' job and thus force
the starving wives to become their concubines. The most
telling sign of the decision to destroy the Chinese com -
munity was the settler realization that these Chinese looked
jOst like Afrikans in "" women's garments "" !
The ten years after the passage of the Exclusion
Act saw the successful annexation of the Chinese economy
on the West Coast. Tacoma and Seattle forced out their
entire Chinese populations at gunpoint. In 1885 the in -
famous Rock Springs, Wyoming massacre took place,
where over 20 Chinese miners were killed by a storm of
rifle - fire as European miners enforced their take - over of
all mining. Similar events happened all over the West. In
1886 some 35 California towns reported that they had
totally eliminated their Chinese populations.
On the coast Italian immigrants burned Chinese
ships and villages to take over most of the fishing industry
by 1890. By that same year most of the Chinese workers in
the vineyards had been replaced by Europeans. By 1894 the
bulk of Chinese labor on the wheat and vegetable farms
had been forced out. Step by step, as fast as they could be
replaced, the Chinese who once built the foundation of the
region's economy were being driven out.
Who took part in this infamous campaign? Vir -
tually the whole of the Euro - Amerikan labor movement in
the U.S., including "" socialists "" and "" Marxists "" . Both of
the two great nationwide union federations of the 19th
Century, the National Labor Union and the later Knights
of Labor, played an active role.(37) The Socialist Labor
Party was involved. The leading independent white labor
newspaper, the Workingman's Advocate of Chicago, was
edited by A. C. Cameron. He was a leader of the National
Labor Union, a respected printing trades unionist, and the
delegate from the N.L.U. to the 1869 Switzerland con -
ference of the Communist First International. His paper
regularly printed speeches and theoretical articles by Karl
Marx and other European Communists. Yet he loudly call -
ed in his newspaper for attacks on the immigrant
""Chinamen, Japanese, Malays, and Monkeys "" from Asia.
Even most "" Marxists "" who deplored the crude violence of
the labor mobs, such as Adolph Doubai (one of the leading
German Communist immigrants), agreed that the Chinese
had to be removed from the U.S.(38) It is easy to predict
that if even European "" Marxists "" were so strongly pulled
along by the lynch mobs, the bourgeois trade union leaders
had to be running like dogs at the head of the hunt. An -
drew Furuseth, the founder of the Seafarers Internation
Union, AFL - CIO, Pat McCarthy, leader of the San Fran -
cisco Building Trades Council, Sam Gompers, leader of
the cigarmakers union and later founder of the American
Federation of Labor (AFL), were just a few of the many
who openly led and incited the settler terror.(39)",1,2017-10-05 17:10:52,aznidentity,t3_74hd2n,t3_74hd2n,dny99u3,"0"

Obviously women could (should) also be more proactive, though I won't get into that issue here. What I would like to mention is how I've been seeing timidity not just offline but online as well.

For instance, on okc I get guys in my inbox who can't seem to find a pathway to asking me out. That's cool; I love shooting the shit, so let's see where this conversation takes us. But then I'll nudge or steer a line and...nothing? Nothing? I'm just, I don't know, am *I* doing something wrong? What is happening?

**:O**

Am I too subtle? Am I? I don't think so, I really don't. I mean, how hard is it to invite someone to a party/event or to offer some solo instruction or to simply bring up the possibility of going someplace nearby? I get how easy it is to miss a hint when conversation moves too fast in person, but this is *okcupid*. Every line is an opportunity to pause and think. So what's going on? Did they get cold feet / change their mind? Are they juggling too many ladies and it's not yet my turn in the queue? Am I about to be catfished? I don't understand.

And all the while that we're chatting, I've got non-Asian males pouring in and asking for my number or to meet up, a mere two messages in - there's even a jackass who point-blank negs me, asking whether I'm only up for Asians 'cause parental say-so and I'm almost thirty - despite or *because* of my profile openly stating I'm here *looking to connect with Asian men*.

I'm not even rude about it. On my profile I give a pretty laidback - if I do say so - explanation why. And some people who fall outside my preferences do take up on my offer for platonic chitchat as stated, whether 'cause they genuinely want to, or because they're hoping I'll change my mind over how awesome they are, or whatever. And the occasional white guy will still confirm with a message checking that Asian is my prerequisite. The good looking one? Asks a straight-up question then politely falls silent without further ado. ('cause he has options, right. He has options and he knows it, so why expend energy or get his ego bruised more than necessary.) The other guy? Up front informs me that when I'm ready for ""a handsome, funny, thoughtful, compassionate white boy"" he'll be here waiting. And then proceeds to engage with a further update just in case.

Anyway. While not every conversation with an Asian male is meandering here and there and all over the place, more often than not, that's how I see it. A fine majority is shooting the breeze. If Asian males want one more thing in common with the white female demographic, you got it. (Albeit not a similarity that you actually want. Ladies be making me feel I'm one of their brunch crew.) Love chatting with you all, I really do. I'd just like to feel a little less confused.

And you, OP? You're approaching in meatspace left and right? Kudos. Really. An example to us all.",3,2017-10-19 03:03:09,aznidentity,t3_76ui6m,t3_76ui6m,dokllcg,"0"

u/likechanel,"I doubt many people here have been to Singapore, much less live the high-income expat lifestyle as described in this post but I'll try and break it down a bit further for you. OP is really correct but it's more focused on him being a non-native rather than being white. Lemme explain: 

The OP uses the term Westerner. It's not an exclusive term for white people in Singapore. I'm East-Asian and I can relate to all of this and more. Although white privilege gives whites a boost, the divide in Singapore rests mostly on income. OP isn't apex because he's white in Singapore, he's apex cause he gets paid a lot. Expats in Singapore aren't really losers back home since losers can't get jobs here teaching english and molesting kids. Also since expats here don't integrate due to the large expat social circles, there are less clashes between (usually white) expats and locals (in terms of dating, at least). WM/local-Singaporean AF is less common than you would think, here. The issue of white/expat worship is a way bigger problem in workplaces. 

I really don't know many mainland-Chinese or other East-Asian expats in Singapore because they're so biased towards hiring foreign talent from Western countries. I know a few Asian-Americans/Canadians working in banking here and living a really cushy lifestyle though. 

---off topic, convenience is hands down my favorite thing about Singapore. Uber/taxi everywhere, can get everything delivered, it's easy to party too and meet lots of **valuable connections** through the expat community, lots of active/nature stuff to do (although biking sucks cause its so hot and theres no bike lanes), food here is over-rated though and rent is hella expensive. Chinese/asian girls here are cute but I prefer the look of northerners, oh and the girls are not conservative here either. Chinese/asian guys here are taller than other asian countries. Girls here are pretty receptive towards Asian American guys here but honestly you won't have much in common with them--local vs expat life is super different. FWIW i got 300 tinder matches in the two months I was staying here, only occasionally using and selectively swiping right. The singaporean english accent sounds like nails to me unfortunately, i dont like it. Also you can fly to Thailand or Indonesia for a weekend on the low.

It's kinda fun to make friends with a local girl though as an expat and show them a whole new lifestyle lol upgrade her from birkenstocks to birken bags xD",3,2017-10-23 04:45:27,aznidentity,t3_78043h,t3_78043h,dor8tk1,"0"

u/WarrioroftheSE,"Although I'm thankful to my parents for giving me an opportunity that I would otherwise not have back home, Growing up  here in the UK was shit.

.As a 10 year old, I was told to just put my head down and accept it that other whites  would shout horribly racist remarks, bear in mind I was 10.

I was mistaken for chinese, I'm a chink, nihao this nihao that, ching chong here ching chong there. Then I was mistaken for Thai, then one drunk old white guy called me a ""jap cunt""  the usual, no one has yet been racist to me correctly lol.

At school, It was 3-4 white kids who would constantly mock me, "" go back to where you came from"", "" Bangkok cunt"" etc. 

I had 1 fight, exactly 1 fight in that school.  Because I couldn't take it anymore, I was 14, for 4 years I held my tongue and just minded my business, went to school, ran to the bus stop then straight to home. But at 14 it was too much ,one day this skinny kid and his 2 fat friends probably didn't like the fact that I was laughing talking to another kid from another class that day.

So they decided to harass me, "" go back the where you came from cunt"" etc. The usual, brushed that off. I hear that all the time, mostly tuned him out. His friends was laughing, then I caught this sentence come out of his mouth, "" your dad is a dirty chink and your mums a cheap cunt"", and that to me crossed the line, by bringing my family into it. The only way I could survive those racist shit they were saying was telling myself "" at least they aren't brining my family into it"", the moment he did, I just saw red. 

Next thing I know, I was in the head of year's office, and he was talking about calling my parents etc. I cried that day, first time in my life I really cried, I told the head of year ""please I will never hit anyone again just don;t call my parents, they've endured enough coming here, I dont want to cause trouble for them"". 

I was lucky the head of year accepted that really, but instead I had to spend a whole month every lunch time in his office doing ""work"", basically rewrite pages from a book.

I mean, as I got older the racism didn't stop, at Uni I don't feel it as much, but I do still feel the stares not as bad in school. When I walk with my white friends or walk with a white female friend, I feel the staring followed by the scowls, makes me fucking laugh xD

The racist shit I encounter are mostly from chavs and or kids then the occasional drunk idiots especially walking home from work, the kids I usually just ignore, although there are days where I wish I could just punch their heads in.  I do have to walk through a bad neighborhood, I mean it's not bad bad but you know filled with kids and teenagers to get to my part time work, I tell you these chav cunts are a waste of space.

For people coming here in the UK, the opportunities especially if you're from a not so well to do country are amazing, and it should go without saying, take advantage of it.

But it's not some kind of good place by any means, it just means there are better opportunities but the people are scum and racist, white brits are some of the most vile and racist pieces of shit the people here in the UK LOVE to think their shit don't stink.",17,2017-10-30 18:35:04,aznidentity,t3_79pfbv,t3_79pfbv,dp3t0te,"0"

This. As messed up as it is to say, the darker the skin the more special she has to be.

Being in Uni, I cross paths with a lot of different groups of Asians. Not to sound braggy but I'm a cheery kind of guy IRL and I usually greet every asian I come accross with, most of the time I get nothing back, sometimes I get like a weird look  very rarely do I get a gretting back xD but it's thanks to I guess my friendly demeanour I have a lot of asian friends that are from different groups. I am a medical student and although its mostly white people in my class, our building is next to the Science and Art building and there's a lot of different asians there, mostly chinese some I'm cool with some who never greet me when I greet them and then some vietnamese guy who was doing Arts that greeted me first which was rare because he thought I was Vietnamese, it was a funny interaction and some FIlipinos who I am all cool with.

EDIT : I just looked it up again theres approximately 70 Spanish/spanish themed restaurants that are in Yelp. Compared to say Chinese restaurants that have over 100 results and probably more, Indian restaurants also have more than 100 results.

u/I_trip_over_hurdles,"Completely agree with this and have personal experience. What is manageable to hear and carry emotionally as a 20-something, is really traumatic as a 12 year old. That's just how human development works. My mom ranting about shit then would traumatize me and make me scared of the world in elementary school, while the same thing today? Just a parent being the vulnerable human being they are and yeah, society and humans suck. 10 years makes a huge difference.

From a different angle, and I come at this from a suburban, helicopter-parent angle (which had quite a presence where I grew up even though physically we were the boonies not the suburbs) is that there are expectations put on kids that are not developmentally appropriate at all. It's one thing to have high expectations and another to have unrealistic expectations. To expect kids not to just get good grades and study for the SAT (realistic expectations) but to have these nebulous ""character"" things discussed by the article. You and I both went to public schools, but for elite-private-school striving parents, the demands that colleges at least pretend to require of teens (unless they're rich and connected enough to buy their way in) is totally totally out of line: https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/the-false-promise-of-holistic-college-admissions/282432/

It's unrealistic to expect a 13 year old's passion to be something worldly and noble for example, rather than masturbating and the pop-star-of-the-day XD",2,2018-01-25 06:00:54,aznidentity,t3_7siujs,t1_dt5i8m3,dt7h12q,"0"
u/I_trip_over_hurdles,"When I went to school in NYC, there was that incident of a (AA) kid being hazed to death (AA frat) at a nearby school. Based on the accounts of the frat's activities, there definately was a bit of an ""identity issues and insecurity, and then taking those issues out on each other"" thing going on that isn't healthy. But I guess it's human nature to displace the BS you face+resulting emotional issues onto easier targets (punching down or horizontally) rather than to punch up. 

It's unfortunate it is this way, and even sadder that it's apparently so obvious that even outsiders (like you) pick up on it. And you're not the only person I know who does. Most of my non-Asian non-white friends have commented on it in some way or form, and my neighbor, who is an Arab immigrant and professor, said to me ""the international students seem much friendlier and comfortable with themselves. My AA students seem insecure about their Asianness or something in a way my international students aren't"" :/ Even one of my closest friends, an AA adoptee, thought the same and remarked that one of her ex'es (AA dude) was insecure about his masculinity and she didn't get why (current BF is a Korean international student.)

I've never been to UCI but I think I understand where that is coming from. My area isn't as AA percentage wise, but I did grow up with quite a few AAs and I was kind of forced into a circle with a few because our parents hung out and brought us along. This circle was AA kids of professional class immigrants, stereotypical high achieving, etc. They also bullied the fuck out of me :/ They would also talk trash about other AA's who weren't as high achieving ""omg that dude is the dumbest Asian I've ever met!"" I also constantly got called a bad Asian constantly, and they really seemed to have hang-ups about stereotypes and either boxing themselves into them, or construct themselves the opposite as if that's not another form of pigeonholing. Now that you mention it, it is weird to remember how obsessed with stereotypes they were and seemed to love policing other AAs. And avoided and excluded FOBs like the plague. So much that I feel sad now because one girl, her cousin came over from China to stay with her family for a bit and she just bullied the shit outta her, avoided her in public, and that cousin ended up going back to China after a miserable experience in the US. I feel sad because she was always nice to me. FOBs at my school either tended to leave me alone or were nice to me. But because I was forced into intimate spaces with AA's like them I think I also got to see sides of them that others might now have seen. Even to this day I get along with FOBs and international students more and most of my Asian friends and acquaintances are FOBs or international. Which is really sad. But I have found great AA friends as well, even through mediums like here, but until very recently (with the political shifts) finding like-minded AAs isn't easy. 

I think what you see is that for AA's of the professional-class-immigrant, high achieving background there is a struggle with identity that comes from being at the intersection of race and class, with their class-status making potential racial issues largely ignored and allowing them to fester. Some of them, and I think those are the UCI types you describe, are insecure about their Asianness in a way that makes them publicly overcompensate by simultaneously playing up their idea of Asianness (and self-stereotyping, self-boxing) in themselves while also eager to somehow distance at the same time. I suspect that the abrasive behavior you describe is an overcompensation from them internalizing the quiet, pushover, Asian stereotype. The poor treatment given to FOBs is because the FOB reminds them of their Asianness and more deeply, reminds them of the foreignness, outsiderness, that comes with being percieved as Asian. They ultimately want to belong (without really questioning the foundations that put them in a shitty societal position in the first place), and FOBs cramp their style, as many still have a ""I can become accepted by American society if only I reject my Asianness more/assimilate more."" 

I still remember a time when our AA circle was gathered (I usually was the quiet listener in the corner, LOL) and one girl was ranting that the damn international students were ruining their image, that they worked so hard and strived to present a hardworking, industrious, high achieving respectability (to whom?) and there those FOBs were being rich and spoiled and not giving a fuck and ruining their image. And these were all high-achievers, well adjusted, ""great character"" on the outside. Another incident was a girl who was bubbly on the outside, popular, teachers thought she was the best thing since sliced bread, an amazing person and student, XD, and she started a Chinese class at the high school ""to share her passion for Chinese culture"" (aka to pad her resume.) On the outside, really well adjusted, awesome person, whole package, right? Yet in more private settings, she would say shit like ""Taylor Swift is ugly because she has Asian eyes"", ""Asian guys aren't cute"" and such. And these students all went on to elite schools (the same schools that so presumptuously make a big deal of judging applicants' ""character"") and are active in AA clubs at those schools :/",0,2018-01-25 06:46:14,aznidentity,t3_7snkgk,t1_dt6iwaq,dt7iljl,"0"

u/I_trip_over_hurdles,"Reminds of me the ""second generation is named John, third generation Giuseppe"" quote XD

Asian American kids, especially from more professional-class backgrounds, get a lot of mixed signals growing up and deal with it in different ways. I think the Asian supremacy thing you see is overcompensation for the realization (often quite late due to those mixed signals) that Asianness is pretty demonized in mainstream society. That realization can be pretty traumatic to adjust to if you were brought up with the ""if you just assimilate more you'll be accepted"" BS. 

Reminds me of a guy who went to Ivies, and you've probably seen a few of his writings, and remarked that ""liberal"" BS at places like those is often gaslighting, because they sell themselves as some progressive, diversity striving place but in reality they're very much socially stratified, old money white guys on top, culture. And if you pick up on this, you are gaslighted because no way, we're totally the paragon of insert-buzzwords-here. ""Liberal"" institutions like schools and Hollywood traditionally, appointed themselves as liberal moral paragons and now we're increasingly seeing that as ""the king as no clothes"" and it can be bittersweet for AA's who've realized the phoniness long ago...

I mean these are the guys, and to be fair, they were the only option available in mainstream pre-2014 or so, who projected the ""I'm so special because I majored in art not STEM, salvation is conforming to white hipsterdom"" mentality as ""progressive"" and encouraged that kind of mentality in young minority kids. I love verbally walloping them (mainstream liberal pretensions) myself, as I enjoy punching up and pointing out inconsistencies XD. And watching them exposed as houses of cards during these ongoing political and social shifts feels kind of sweet in a way. https://planamag.com/master-of-nones-failed-liberalism-a-chance-for-asian-american-progress-21ac11c50a69

https://planamag.com/why-are-asian-american-kids-killing-themselves-477a3f6ea3f2

There is also this consideration: that professional class AA's may be impacted by relative class privilege in the sense that because they seem closer to the ""top,"" closer to the holy grail of ""making it,"" they actually bump into the glass ceiling more and therefore can sometimes be rudely shocked into the reality that no, you won't ever be truly accepted and there's a limit to how far you can go under our rules.",0,2018-01-25 20:41:13,aznidentity,t3_7snkgk,t1_dt7zxw2,dt8k4jt,"0"

u/darkerose,"Don't worry about the wall of text xD It gives me more to talk about, and helps with fleshing out my perspective. 

The black community has more history behind not trying to fit it unlike Asians. They were literally slaves for the white man: They had their freedom taken from them, they were kept ignorant and without means to communicate, they were taken from their homes, their women were raped, and their history is well-documented thanks for the civil war. Any history class is a constant reminder, whereas the history of discrimination against Asians in the US isn't taught until students are in advanced history courses. Also, systematic racism is more stacked against blacks than Asians: They are seen as hoodlums rather than a model minority. Innocent Black teens being shot on the news is constant reminder that the west still hates blacks, and black women are often seen as undesirable in all dating sites. On contrast, many Asians are satisfied being seen as a model minority because they think that the myth benefits them. So they keep their mouths shut to avoid rocking the boat. What those Asians don't realize is that the moment they fail to meet that myth's expectations, they are automatically viewed as failures or disappointments. These are the Asians that throw up the white flag - many of these Asians are AAs, and are also part of the millennial generation which is pretty known to not vote due to voter apathy. They don't bother to try to change anything, but they sit back to complain or become engrossed in their ignorance by justifying that they are better off than other minorities. They ultimately fail to realize that problems shouldn't be swept under the rug, even if they seem minor at the first glance.  As for the enclaves, they are either ignorant or they believe they are completely safe in their bubbles. 

As for the hapas, I believe that the older generations are more dismissive. Not necessarily the young ones. I can't speak for all Asians, but I don't consider myself inclusive with outsiders. Especially whites. We can be friends, but I'll never expect them to truly understand or empathize. As for hapas, I try to pick up whether they align themselves with being Asian, or whether they fancy themselves as white, or are happy with having the best of both worlds. Just as some Asians have problems with white worship, so do some hapas. Anna Akana is an example (I was surprised she was a hapa. Thought she was just a pretty Asian lady). She speaks for Asian women and against yellow fever, yet she always dates and brings white men as her guests in her videos: She is a hapa that I don't want as part of Asian activism because she behaves in the same manner as Asian feminists. Especially since she buys into the Asian men reminds her of her brother thing .-. I am wary of hapas like Akana that play up their white or Asian side depending on the the situation. For hapas that choose their Asian side and identify as one, I would welcome.

You're not a hypocrite for interacting with white people lol. It's next to impossible to not associate with a white person at the west. As for those Asian feminists, they most likely think they fished up an extra special white guy: ""He's different! He doesn't have yellow fever!"". But they are wrong. Centuries of white privilege doesn't suddenly go away, and they are pushing the idea of Asian women are easy as long as the guy is white because they are dating them, yet pretending they're spiteful toward white supremacy. They are fine with spouting lip service as long as they can make money, can date the man of their dreams, and benefit in every way while ignoring Asian men and their rights.

Agree on the reddit is cathartic xD It's known for being an echo chamber sometimes. And here on Reddit, you can talk to real people as oppose other forms of social media where you try to pretend that your life is the most interesting thing ever. But while you can keep the rose colored lens off, please keep the cynicism in check. It doesn't make you happy, and it can make you difficult to be around to others close to you in real life. One summer my parents once told me it wasn't fun to talk at that point because I was so bitter and cynical. Don't be like summer me.

kinda like thailand and philipines ammirite? Difference unlike in thailand and philipines, those white civilians /military  in Iraq and afganistan are scared shitless of being kidnapped and geting their dicks chopped off if they are caught openly molesting arab/pashtun women or fucking child prosties.

&gt;Indian and Arab females females are also not sexualized 

wut lol? know how popular arab porn star mia kalifa and indian porn star sunny leone are  on pornhub?

And maybe 1 reason why white guys are afraid to call arab females ""sucky, sucky sand ni^^er"" and propositioning them is bc they are afraid of getting stabbed by her arab brothers/father?

&gt;if you basically keep saying Asians are the problem, which you have done so again. 

let's say that asian culture and asian passiveness/docility plays a big part in the problem of for example why white men nowadays feel not only entitled to white but also asian women. 

There was also an OP by an asian female  on this sub who complained about how a buncha Nigerian dudes assumed she was a prostitute and harrased her.

I like the fact that most people don’t know it’s an ace up my sleeve, an ace I’m very proud of, regardless of what I look like.”

In his own words: _""An ace up my sleeve, an ace I'm very proud of, regardless of what I look like""._ Meaning: I can claim a minority status, stance or identity, that people are discriminated against for being, but I take pride in revealing this when I want to. That means, to him race appears a choice. The ""regardless of what I look"" is just self-flattery as he knows he has a look that is acknowledged as attractive and this has to do with him being seen as white. No one is faulting him for the way he looks. All in all, Criss is honest by saying it would be unfair to claim status as an Asian-American, and we should respect him for that. What he's being called out on is this ""omg what race do you think I am? I'm actually half-Asian! Isn't that cool xD"". Like literally wtf. He doesn't experience racism because he isn't an Asian man, but gets to sail through society on a wave of white male privilege only to joke around about having an Asian heritage.

u/darkrood,"1. ""Fighting against what you hate "" and ""protecting who you love"" are often reasonable motives throughout the film for each character. Nowhere did Rose and her sister showed that ""we are not fighting against what we hate (1st order)."" Their family bond, though touching, does not suffice as evidence for the pure ideology of ""fighting only to protect whom you love."" It is a war after all.

2. I have no idea what the last sentence was about, so I will skip that. Rose and Finn were there to find code breaker, who only showed up with sheer luck. The betrayal was unsurprising though.

3. Nope, some made it back, some got picked off. They had no weapon nor any plan for attack. It is suicide.

4. Plan was bad:
a. There was likely spy on the ship, else who sneaked in the tracker? The moment when they were loading up the escape pod, said spy could easily relay that information.

b. Even if she refused to let Poe know, She could've let others know, Poe's mutiny is backed by others.

c. At war, You can count on your enemies not using scanner. XD That was just bad script writing. Btw, how did she know when or what 1st order use for scanner? She definitely had no intel on 1st order, else she'd have known about the tracking device. 

d. I don't know whether the allies would come. This is where the continuity of script fucked up big time. 1st order lost their major weapon that bring planet destruction, yet NONE of the allies did anything before, during, and after. The whole spaceship chase of the film feels more like a bully chasing his only victim on school playground than a crazy gun touting shooter sighted on campus. NOBODY ELSE CARED.

u/comment_preview_bot,"Here is the comment linked in the above comment: 

You make a lot of good points, and a lot of what you said the Asian community goes through is the same things that the Black community goes through..

A few examples: who's ""our"" funniest guy? Dave Chappelle. Married to a Filipino woman. Who were ""we"" rooting for at the Oscars? Jodan Peele who is married to a white woman. Kanye West... we know how that goes.

We don't completely support these people as human beings, but when it comes to art that WE feel represent US, we'll rally behind it despite their personal romance issues. The Chappelle Show and Get Out both accurately depicted what it's like being a black male in society, so we rallied behind that, ESPECIALLY when in competition with the rest of white Hollywood.

Most of the statements about Lil Wayne's stance on Black Live Matter were used as ammo by conservatives, but called out by black people. (As a person he was called out) but since HIS art reflects typical African American street life we rally behind him.

Drake, mixed, but still gets loved because its HIS art against pop. So despite all of the personal issues with these people, their art (AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T BASH US) deserves support because that's how we change the visuals. ""Fuck yeah! Get Out won for best screenplay!"" ""Yeah! Dave Chappelle got that 50 million dollar Netflix deal). 

The difference (and I think this is what you're pointing to) is Dave Chappelle doesn't use his platform to show himself only dating Asian women and saying ""I don't like Black women, they remind me of my mom."" I think all of his skits (except one) on the Chappelle Show had him married to a black woman. 

Separate your support in two camps. Those whose art you think depicts you accurately and well, and those who embody your ideals. You can praise the message while criticizing the messenger. Black women have spoken and said things like ""I like the movie Get Out, but don't really support Jordan Peele's decision to marry a white woman."" At the end of the day the majority of people aren't looking deeply into anyone's backgrounds or politics but their art.

Jodan Peele is married to a white woman, but used his platform to highlight black actors, like the main dude who went on to win the Golden Globes and be in Black Panther. It also was a historic win for Black directors/writers (I think it was the first film to be nominated for best writer and director by a first time film maker). 

And don't take this as critical of your post because I understand your points: ""Jeremy Lin is a bible thumping beta chan,"" esports is nerdy"" ----- how do we break the mold?

YOU DON'T. You fucking own that shit. ""Black people are all good dancers"" - YEAH NOW LOOK AT THIS MOTHER FUCKER MOONWALK. ""Blacks are good at basketball"" - DAMN FUCKING STRAIGHT, now watch us dominate the league. 

STEREOTYPES ARE NEGATIVE IF YOU LET THE OTHER TELL YOU IT'S GOOD OR BAD.

Some say, 'black people need to stop dancing"" but Beyonce can sell $400 nosebleed seats to white people and they will pay it gladly and scream ""yass queen!"" In the FGC (fighting game community) you know who is the man to black gamers? Japanese Daigo. When it comes to Starcraft, if you're not Korean don't even waste your time trying to learn how to play because you already lost. 

I know this stat isn't exactly true, but Asians have looked upon certain things negatively ""man they think we're all smart, and are the most successful financially! THEY'RE WRONG, what about the average immigrants who barely make ends meet working at a store...""

Flip that logic: ""Ughhh, white people say we're good at sports and music and that our dicks are huge... What about all of the Kevin Hart sized people, I BET THEY HAVE TINY DICKS... We don't all have huge dicks.""

Nope. Own that shit, because those comments are done out of jealousy. White people are going after your success in colleges and complaining. They're saying we can't make as much money as you! They're running to your women, and more often than not dating some unattractive Asian woman just because...

Criticize and praise whoever you want but know what people will hear as a message.

""Ali Wong is thriving off of being a token asian and doesn't represent us so I'm going to not watch her special."" = ""An Asian can't be successful on Netflix, let's sign more white people.""

The reason you have ""house negroes' and ""Uncle Toms"" is because these people feel they can thrive off of white acceptance before they could with Black acceptance. And I think that's the issue with a lot of the Asian feminist examples you gave. If ""they"" and others felt like ""shit... Asian men have my back and THEY are my audience"" they will make more shit FOR you that represent you better. Anna Akanna isn't worrying about Asian men, because it's easier to be a token and use the ""outsider perspective"" while catering to white people. 

MAKE YOUR STARS. Find someone with a podcast who is talking about the shit you believe in and share it here and with your friends. If they have a modest Patreon throw them a dollar a month so they can get a better mic or equipment to compete. 

====

The thing I like about this is sub is you guys are woke, but sometimes attribute activism with being woke. You guys see the complexities in human beings and race issues more than most. Sometimes you have to be a little quiet to make a louder shout. If blacks attacked every black star for whatever we disagree with we'd have just unknown super black radicals. Sometimes we have to deal with a Kanye West complaining about the fashion industry so we can have our Jay Z and Beyonce, the super black power couple. 

The short of it, don't support anyone who makes your job harder or pushes you down. Call them out as you have been with the Uncle Chans and Lus, but for each person you do that to you HAVE TO HAVE someone to put in their place. 

If you fire your whole company with no one to replace them you just lost your business.

u/historybuff234,"Yesterday, I posted rather silly plots from an unscientific survey of one night stand preferences of Taiwanese women as a fun way to start the week. https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/88zqxd/ Today's post is actually serious, and focuses on how Taiwanese media portray interracial relationships. The above charts, with my translations, were taken from a 2013 paper entitled ""CCR正流行？探討臺灣媒體如何建構異國戀框架"" (Trans: ""How Popular Is CCR [Cross-Cultural Relationship]? Deep Exploration of How Taiwanese Media Frame Cross-Cultural Relationships""), published by the Chinese Communication Society. http://ccs.nccu.edu.tw/paperdetail.asp?HP_ID=1543

If your Chinese is up to it, I strongly encourage reading through the paper. It has many interesting nuggets. For example, it states that the positive and negative reporting of transnational romantic relationships by Taiwanese media is heavily dependent on the nationality of the foreign men. Relationships with men from developed countries and America and Europe in particular were given positive press. Relationships with men from undeveloped countries such as Nigeria were given negative coverage.

This is the author's final conclusion:

&gt; 綜合所有分析結果而論 ，台灣媒體所建構的異國戀框架，是將「異國戀建構為一種特殊的戀愛模式，這戀愛模式中的外籍男方，一定是具有吸引台灣女生的外表和特別溫柔體貼的行為和開放思想」 ，也就是說台灣媒體所形塑的異國戀框架，是一種吹捧鼓勵大眾談異國戀的框架

&gt; Taking all of the above analysis into consideration, the framing of transnational romantic relationships created by Taiwanese media is based on: ""characterizing transnational relationships as a special form of love, and any foreign men in such relationships as attractive to Taiwanese women by physical features, especially tender and caring behavior, and open-mindedness."" In other words, the framing of transnational romantic relationships created by Taiwanese media is one that encourages the public to enter into transnational romantic relationships.

With that type of media environment, the existence of ""white preference"" in Taiwan is entirely unsurprising. Who wouldn't want to date white if the media is so overwhelmingly positive about it? I could not help but think that academic studies of media reports in other Asian countries would yield the same results and the same conclusions.",7,2018-04-03 15:41:45,aznidentity,t3_89f2jf,t3_89f2jf,dwqh4i6,"0"

u/iEatsFood,"I definitely think that China's public transport is one of our best achievements. Trains in China are efficient and you can get to pretty much anywhere on them, if you're going to a rural place you might have to board an older model train, which are clunky, but the bigger cities all have fast trains. I love how they're really smooth and it's kinda low key satisfying to see all the buildings flash past outside the window while you don't really feel much. xD 

The reason why China can get these fast trains while America etc can't is because of demand. China has so many people to ride the trains so they're profitable and get developed fast. China's also building trains in Africa. As long as there's a demand, Chinese trains will become more and better.",13,2018-04-13 06:27:07,aznidentity,t3_8bw0mb,t3_8bw0mb,dxacuj6,"0"

u/Where2cop857,"XD. So much for their biblical virtues of Christianity.

WASP white-shoe law firms reluctantly embraced Curtain Lace Catholic-Kennedy-esque Irish, then give away to the Jews (and assimilated/integrated Italians in NYC) after WW2. 

The now-WASPified “G o y”-mutt-Caucasian-whatever-yolo-mixed Jews in high-powered professions and public positions get their sheckles and weld their power to liberal policies or whichever left-right candidate to continue to back the Israel homeland, if not for making the monetary diplomatic aid “a non issue”. You can tell which “Caucasian” if a Jew because they are cognizant and self-aware a lot more in articulating the quandaries with current political and social issues. Lol Probably because all the sheckles alone won’t protect them and the Homeland itself nowwithstanding the need to engage in politics unlike apolotical/areligious Asians who just want a fair chance to compete/work coming from a Confucian-based scholar-beaucratic-heirarchical five-thousand year meritocratic civilization.

I mean when Sheldon Adelson or George Soros (who BTW is seriously viewed as a financial terrorist by PLA officers in the 1999 book ‘Unrestricted Warfare’ bc of his profitable Asian currency short-position which destabilized their capital flows thereby requiring central bank intervention and therefore hurting their Asiatic regional domestic economy) comes knocking on your lobbying and campaign donation door, you duly bend-over and suck them off just like proletariat sexpst white trash going to sold-out Western Colonial conquered SEA nations looking for E-Z game “feminine/subservient” poontang with their SS(DI)/VA Disability/Pension/Worksmancomp settlement yolo money.

u/Where2cop857,"IMO fashion especially in America is dying FWIW. “MFA uniform” is loosely inspired by /r/navyblazer Ivy/Trad style with pleb-tier watered-down cheaper casual basics. The [Andover Shop in Harvard Square](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/04/18/the-andover-shop-harvard-square-salon-for-jazz-artists-and-literati-for-sale/Vt5wsNQ8QWmR7oDdp4xwpN/amp.html) is up for sale and the preeminent WASP idolized Ralph Lauren brand founded by a NYC working class Jew who changed his name that recently posted poor quarterly earnings with restructuring plans. Smaller what was once up and coming menswear boutiques and labels have closed over the years. Free &amp; Easy a Japanese magazine which is focused more Americana alongside with Ivy Prep went out of print. I fell out of interest in fashion nowadays due to the lost of asthetic direction and industry consolidation.

You have foreign labels Kamakura and Thom Browne (which most of their offerings are manufactured in Japan BTW) doing a better higher end job with a contemporary silhouette. Band of Outsiders tried to make way but it went bankrupt. J. Crew has long lost their core customer base and will likely bankrupt soon too, if not for their women’s Madewell line. H&amp;M which is sort-of Nordic prep cucked themselves with the South Africa misstep and NYT has reported $4b in unsold inventory—that’s fast-fashion garments rotting away.

Just parse through the major fashion forums understand the creative thought process on how people form their basic foundations for their style. I never indulge in curated IG for fashion-inspo pics—always preferring to scrutinize individual garmets to analyze if it works for me and my exsisting wardrobe. There’s no written textbook for satorial or style advice as it’s all inherently subjective. Understand fit and what color palette works for you and avoid alterations for Ready-to-Wear pieces as much as you can unless it’s a bespoke suit.

However, I will say that most Asian dudes are lean and skinny with a good skin tone to wear versatile high fashion clothes. It’s a cluster-fuck in the middling tier offerings segment as the details, construction, fabric sourcing, design, pattern silhouette all congregate to the top echelon of fashion. If you can save up for legit designer fashion pieces it would be worthwhile unlike a pasty pale white ginger dude. No hate on the pale ginger girls tho insofar the hair matches everywhere, especially down below. Anyways, I think the new fashion tend nowadays is anti-fashion—and no not the FOB Anti-Social-Social-Club bullshit. XD",4,2018-04-23 09:21:49,aznidentity,t3_8e9khh,t3_8e9khh,dxtkfcy,"0"

The problem is HOW we attempt to differentiate.

&gt;The alternative then? Not to shit on Mainland China. I mean, we don't have to denounce them every chance we get xD

Unfortunately Asians have historically been complicit in divide and conquer because we ourselves attempt to differentiate by nationality. As you said, this has proven to not be in our best interests. We can and should still distance ourselves from negative stereotypes, however keep ethnicity out of it. Instead of attributing race and nationality, Asians should differentiate by [[other means]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_riche). In my mind, this is actually the correct indicator for this behavior anyways.

Yeah I’m gonna go with projection there

Bit funny that one post he goes off with every caricatured stereotype ever, then accuses others of racism XD Definately some projection going on there. Did tourists steal his life savings or something? Lots of unresolved anger and baggage it seems. Also why is he using “we” as if he’s Thai? And if I’m gonna play with tourist stereotypes here, I’d take rude loud crowded people over child sex trafficking anyday, but what do I know? 

Spitting at others for superiority complexes and cultural chauvinism is the most ironic thing ever given that it’s the western mindset that assumes its ways are the only ways/must convert others, my ways are universal, or basically a Cartesian dualist mindset that sets black vs. white in which one must win/beat/negate/dominate the other. “My ways are better” sentiment can be found universally, but the Western (maybe abrahamic religion-influenced culture in general?) version of it has caused a lot more destruction to other cultures and mentalities, even its own (since Europe has a lot of pre-Christian history of various kinds too) Relativism was considered newfangled and revolutionary in Western view but many many cultures have had concepts of it and Chinese ways are actually a lot more amenable to it. “What works for us doesn’t necessarily work for them.” 

“They’re inferior barbarians, we must convert/save/subjugate/whatever them” vs “they’re inferior barbarians we must stay away/keep their ways out from our ways/ignore them/they can never be like us” as a broad generalization. Of course things aren’t that clear-cut (and this binary thinking is another ‘western’ mentality) One certainly leaves cultures more intact 🤷🏻‍♀️

Asian girl with white boyfriend does NOT EQUATE to Anti-Asian sentiment. Of course there are famous examples of Asian girl (as well as Asian guys) with white partners where both of them are racist, bigoted to their own people. However my main point is DON""T GENERALIZE! Or else fake ""feminist"" will use this as ammo!

Plus are you kidding me with ""Asian Obama""? Why do people think Barack Obama is a great president? He is a neoliberal president who funded by big corporations!!!!

Your only point is ""Wall St""...I can give you that since WE all know powerful Wall street people are crooks (as well as the environment that breeds corruption), in which Obama DID NOT put them in JAIL for the recession/financial crisis!

u/Akilos01,"Clickbait title. Article says:

&gt;It is important to understand that “East Turkistan” is what Uyghur militants and separatists refer to Xinjiang as. Beijing does not recognize this name. NED – by recognizing the term “East Turkistan” – is implicitly admitting that it supports separatism in western China, even as the US decries separatists and alleged annexations in places like Donbass, Ukraine and Russian Crimea.

&gt;And more than just implicitly admitting so, US NED money is admittedly provided to the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) which exclusively refers to China’s Xinjiang province as “East Turkistan” and refers to China’s administration of Xinjiang as the “Chinese occupation of East Turkistan.” On WUC’s website, articles like, “Op-ed: A Profile of Rebiya Kadeer, Fearless Uyghur Independence Activist,” admits that WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer seeks “Uyghur independence” from China.

According to links *the article provided* to the [National Endowment for Democracy](https://www.ned.org/region/asia/china-xinjiang-east-turkistan-2017/) the USA has contributed half a million to the *Uyghur Human Rights Project*, and *World Uyghur Congress* combined. 

A cursory google search of these groups shows no ties to militancy or violent extremism. Seperatism is a 100% legitimate ideology for any group of people, period. Everyone has the right to *campaign* for a nation of their own if they desire it - whether they get it or not is an entirely separate issue and truly the **actual** problem would be if the separatists were turning towards violent means to achieve that goal. For these two groups at least we have zero evidence of that being the case.

The article also says:

&gt;Where Uyghur terrorists are being trafficked through on their way to foreign battlefields, Beijing-friendly governments like Bangkok are sending suspects back to face justice in China. In nations like Malaysia where *US-backed opposition* (emphasis added) has recently come to power, Uyghur terror suspects are being allowed to proceed onward to Turkey.

The article makes sure to mention the current government of Malaysia is US backed^^TM as if that automatically implies the United States *ordered* these terror suspects sent to Turkey for training with zero evidence. So on the one hand we have an article decrying the United States and western media for jumping the gun in regards to the question of Uyghur internment camps, claiming there is no evidence for them. Then they turn around and make some claims to prove their point of view without providing any evidence.

Hypocrisy aside they provided other links to ""prove"" their other point regarding US funding of ""faux-human rights organizations"" yet the most important link - that which would tie the USA to actual terrorism and militancy is missing. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying the USA is acting in good faith or that the general overview of the article is wrong. Obviously based on this article it's clear the USA is supporting Uyghur seperatism, and we know that often when the USA picks and chooses a group to ""support"" in regards to ""spreading democracy"" it usually means giving them arms and access to military advisors but based on what they've shown here that can not conclusively *be proven* to be the case. 

As it stands the facts are USA is supporting Uyghur seperatism, financially. There are situations that *suggest* the USA is supporting militant seperatism (unsurprising) but let the facts be facts and let the speculation be speculation. No one is served well by jumping the gun for shit like this.",-9,2018-11-06 19:37:55,aznidentity,t3_9ur48l,t3_9ur48l,e96falj,"0"

u/Slonkx,"You’re strawmaning my position right now, which shows me that haven’t even been listening to what said at all. Point me to where I said that asians attack blacks at a higher rate. If you can point me to where I said that, then I’ll stop this discussion. What am I am saying is that, unless we have a definitive source free from bias on a topic like this, it’s useless to attempt to argue something like this due to the fact that there could be multiple variables at play that are just out of our hands when it comes to controlling them. [Here](https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status/997135275762507777?s=21) is a crime happening in a similar severity to the ones you listed, so we can stop the sub-80 IQ response of, “you can’t even give evidence bro xD.” 

No one is saying that the amount of reports isn’t indicative of something happening, I’m saying that the amounts of reports that we just don’t see could be crucial to this topic. If we focus hard on just what we saw, society would have been fucked before either of us were ever born. I’m not particularly invested in either side of this argument, I’m literally just arguing for better data use on your part (and if the best source for data is so fallible, then drop your side), and that’s always been my argument. If you can’t grasp with the idea that perhaps it’s not the best to base ones opinions on pure headlines, then feel free to stop responding.",1,2018-11-24 02:20:26,aznidentity,t3_9z189f,t1_eabzia3,eac4ghh,"0"

u/BlueHinaichigo,"Hi. I just wanna say that I think it's commendable that you decided to come onto this forum to share and inquire about your thoughts especially on one that can appear to be not friendly at times towards Asian women who like white guys.

I totally get where you're coming from when you say that when you reflect, you notice that you've been attracted to more white men than Asian men. There are beautiful people with the traits you desire in all races unless we're talking about the light colored eyes and Caucasian face structure. If you find yourself especially attracted to those features, there's honestly nothing much anyone else can do or say about it to change your mind xD Just don't cut out Asian guys from your dating pool based on stereotypes. See and treat all the guys you come across as unique individuals. You might end up surprised.

Basically, you need to get rid of the stereotypes in your head.",8,2018-12-19 19:06:33,aznidentity,t3_a7nmtl,t3_a7nmtl,ec4p0v8,"0"

u/BlueHinaichigo,"&gt; So many white gay guys are incredibly racist, assuming that the Asian guy is automatically a bottom and that claiming that emblazoning ""NO ASIANS"" on their dating profiles is just a preference rather than something discriminatory.

This is so true. It's so ironic since you'd think they'd be more open given the oppressive past towards the LGBT community, minorities in general. Lesbians tend to be the most accepting of interracial relationships, but with gay men, especially white gay men, it's like the complete inverse. At least the borderline alt-right confederate gun-toting straight white men ""love"" their Asian wives, however twisted it may be xD White gays will strictly stick to their own and outright reject and demean Asians, blacks, and some brown people from the get-go.

White gay men are the group I would dub as the most racist group in America generally speaking, trumping all other race, orientation, and gender combinations. Maybe tied or only bested by straight white women.

&gt; And then we have gay Asian guys who only seek white guys and perpetuate these really annoying stereotypes of ""all Asian guys are just ugly and don't speak the same language as me and don't understand me"". Preferring white guys could be emblematic of their self-hating and internalizing their Sinophobia, but these ""potato queens"" (as they call themselves) don't want to have these different conversations.

Given that gay marriage is legal already and Asians hardly exist on the scale for crimes and STDs, this self-hating internalized racism is probably the issue I would rate that should be given top priority in the Asian American gay community, at least for what's left of the community.... if there still is one LOL!!

The gaysians who perpetuate these self-hating racist ideas, imo, are so much more worse and sadder than the typical white-worshipping Lu. Not only are they generally treated as second-rate by western society thus sharing a similar spot with the average straight Asian male, but they perpetuate the same white worshipping thoughts as the Lu xD Probably almost like an uncle chan but I think uncle chans would at least prefer their Asian women as partners unlike the white-washed gaysian. It's a bit funny at first but so incredibly sad when you think about it.

&gt; Maybe I should've posted this on /r/gaysian or /r/askgaybros, but the former doesn't want to talk about postcolonialism, and the latter often brims with conservative white gay guys (yes, they exist) who not only voted for Trump willingly but also hurls racist epithets if anybody challenges them on the ""preferences =/= prejudices"" notion.

Will you get banned on the gaysian subreddit if you post this topic? 

And yeah don't bother on the AGB one. It's infested with ignorant white gays, white worshipping Asians, and quite simply, people who won't give a damn about this. The gays who support Trump in that subreddit are a super minority though. There's just a few of them who are very vocal. Say you support Trump in that subreddit and and you will get downvoted to oblivion.",2,2019-01-05 09:05:43,aznidentity,t3_acrof2,t1_eda9kxn,edaf3vi,"0"
u/BlueHinaichigo,"&gt; and they're cautious so as to not antagonize white gays.

Ewww that's kinda borderline pathetic. Hence why I like no holds barred subs like AI and a few certain other subs where they do call out and acknowledge white privilege/entitlement issues not caring how white people will feel xD",2,2019-01-05 09:57:16,aznidentity,t3_acrof2,t1_edafrgx,edah1q6,"0"

u/BlueHinaichigo,"These Lu's have got to stop using the term ""interracial relationship"" in their articles to rake in every other race and gender which will result in diverting and misrepresenting the issue at hand, which is specifically WMAF relationships.  Cuz when readers who have absolutely no idea about this special pairing come across an article written by Lu's like this author, Celeste, Tria, etc, they're gonna think Asian guys who don't have positive opinions on WMAF, are just being misogynistic, xenophobic, and/or racist when in fact, there are deeper, repressed, and unique factors at play here.

Asian women with internalized racism are just going to continually type and print out articles like these. I feel some woke individuals have to really start live debating Lu's on public platforms with a diverse audience. Like it's not enough anymore to just vent online and write counter opinions. The author who wrote this article hosts a podcast. She should invite guests to discuss this topic with her. There the guests can corner her and bring up the online dating and response rates based on race and why they are heavily positively skewed towards white men.

Also speaking of her podcast, she has an Instagram account for her podcast and it's full of pictures of people of color. I'm guessing they talk about race and diversity but the fact that she seems to be so immersed in this while being in a relationship with a white guy... xD that's a bit ridiculous.

And lastly, my opinion on the harassment she gets... she mentions that she gets links to articles featuring disturbing content of white guys killing their Asian partners. I feel like this may be a bit too much? Her ideas definitely warrant fair critique but I imagine overly aggressive harassment and hurling of obscenities towards some Asian women will not net positive results for the movement.

u/KatamariBalls,"&gt; This is only true if the dominant culture isn't white and most these couples children end up white-washed.

Except AMWF gradually erodes the dominant culture on a masculine dominated standpoint due to America essentially being a patriarchal society. America is ultimately controlled by WM, not by WF. Optics has a lot to do with this. Now imagine AMWF largely outnumbering WMAF in the superpower nation known as USA (the main bastion of White supremacy and Western imperialism) and its Anglo allies of England, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. As AMs partnering up with WFs become more common, this sends out the message that WMs failing to attract the female equivalent of the same culturally dominant status as them, leads to a loss of their social currency on top. Why? Because it pretty much says, ""Damn, WMs are so pathetic. Despite having all this White/Western Male privilege, they're still unable to secure a WF partner on their level. WMs are inadequate as men!"". It signals to the public that there must be something wrong with WMs since WFs rather be partners with AMs/non-WMs. Hmmm...that strangely sounds familiar to what happened with a particular male demographic, but one major difference is that they're socially disadvantaged within those Anglo countries. In other words, the ultimate meaning behind AMWF symbolizes the defeat of WM oppression, White supremacy, and Western colonization/imperialism. After all, WMs are primarily the leaders of Western civilization.

&gt; Let's take Hollywood's accidental first sex symbol for example
&gt;
&gt; And that requires you to pair with WF how?

Again, the point flew over head. See my prior explanation above this one.

&gt; I'll tell you the bare bone reason - sexual politics. It has been the primary cause of why Hollywood has been very cautious to depict AMs in a positive hetero sexual light ever since and have amplified the emasculation of AMs instead through other mediums or forms of media besides film.
&gt; 
&gt; Or work to dismantle the structure rather than join it?

Fundamentally, AMs taking WFs as partners further diminishes the chances of WMs (specifically talking about the real White supremacist type and there is a substantially large amount of them who only stick with White women while considering non-Whites as inferior, seeking ways to screw them over simultaneously) continuing their so called ""pure"", ""Aryan"", and ""superior"" gene pool that they're obsessed with. Lol! That's the reason why American media tried to completely destroy the AMs image - to eliminate competition with White women because White men were afraid they might lose them to Asian men.

Strength in numbers play a part too since Asians are arguably the largest human demographic on earth AND tend to have a surplus of males anyway. Minus well push a big portion in the excess quantity of AMs towards Anglo WFs, denying Anglo WMs to reproduce full White children with their female half, effectively lessening their dangerous Anglo influence on a global scale from decreasing numbers. Rest of AMs should make big families with mentally sound and healthy AFs (Asian women who are NOT Lus and Rangs). XD

Growing up, those kinds of remarks were flattering but it reached a point during high school where I started feeling that such compliments were a bit discomforting and eventually I got over it. Like nowadays you can tell me that but I won't feel flattered at all anymore. I'd still honestly feel happy receiving flattering compliments but it's all gonna go down south if you bring up my white-ness and imply that the only reason I look attractive to you is cuz I'm part white or look part white. Say stuff like this to me Tinder and I will start replying less and less and start ghosting you. 

Also, in regards to a few of the comments here(not you OP xD), I think it's too much of a reach to assume that all or most mixed people go through absolute hell growing up. There are indeed times where your differences will be pointed out but it's not like, an indicator of total doom.

How many times have you heard an Asian guy share his experience with racism and self-hate from an Asian woman. ""Ewwww thats like dating my cousin"", ""Asian guys are feminine nerds, I am just not attracted to them xD"". 

&amp;#x200B;

How about you stop gas lighting and trying to erase people-of-color's experiences to push your agenda.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at what you said

&gt; Second of all, given the context that all XFs discriminate against AMs,  it's hard to imagine a case where AFs wouldn't discriminate against AMs  as well. 

In the data, black Men are also heavily discriminated against by all women. OH EXCEPT BY THEIR OWN RACE OF BLACK WOMEN who overwhelmingly prefer their own race-- 8x more than AF prefer their own race.

&amp;#x200B;

***I 100% agree with you that societal factors are contributing to AF hating on AM, but you are pretending that Asian women are incapable or they lack the agency to think for themselves-- and that is pretty misogynistic.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

In a world ruled by white men, it is perfectly normal for marginalized people of color to be frustrated with people who uphold and support the status quo of white supremacy. Here's some MORE evidence of AF being racist against People of Color (including Asian men).

u/BlueHinaichigo,"&gt;I don’t see a very bright future for asian males and females at all and it is terribly disappointing.

You mean primarily for Asians living in western countries but I do acknowledge the colonial mentality and white-worshipping beliefs and material still seeping through all of Asia.

Yeah... I totally get what you feel here. The gendered racism of Asians in the west can be such a complicated thing to talk about especially between people with varying experiences and personalities that it feels like there's hardly any progress with bridging different Asian communities. Personally, I wish more Asians of any gender, sexual orientation, or age could feel more ok with posting their experiences here.

u/[deleted],"Ok. So I don't watch their videos, so to anyone who does, please correct or enlighten me if I'm misjudging some of the hosts on their shows.

I found it a bit sad how the other two Asian guys didn't react at all, like they were just quiet about the whole thing. I'm a bit astounded at the lack of comprehension and introspection on their part in regards to the tweet. Like that realtor's tweet wasn't just solely about BTS's appeal or attractiveness. He projected that onto all Asian men in general with that tweet. Like the two of you guys look Asian. That includes the two of you as well xD It's that particular passivity to acts of racism that further enables those perpetrators to express themselves without fear of repercussions. The two of them are on air free to express their opinions and there is no conflict that's currently present that they're involved in so why not give your opinion and speak out against it. There's no excuse. The black lady was so much more into it than they were. It's sad how there are people outside of the Asian community who are more woke on Asian issues than majority of Asians themselves. The Asian community really needs better representation, especially Asian guys.

But on the other hand it's not really surprising given how a lot of Asians in the west have a mindset of ""I'm not like those other Asians"".",24,2019-05-02 23:29:24,aznidentity,t3_bk0ty5,t3_bk0ty5,emd2jc5,"0"

Unlike most groups, They were active af on Twitter and Youtube from the get-go but their fans (called the ARMY) promoted them obnoxiously all over the internet to the point where it became a infamous meme in the Kpop community, ""Any Army here? XD"". Everywhere you go, you'll find their fans commenting about them even if it's not related to them whatsoever. While that was happening, Kpop kept growing in popularity and One Direction broke up/took a hiatus and western kids needed a new boy band to fangirl over. BTS who already had a bigger presence than other kpop groups due to their annoying fans, were there to fall in those kids lap at the right place and time. They kept getting bigger, their fans became louder and western media eventually took the bait, gave them a bigger platform by nominating them for top social artist, they won and fans went nuts! Others witnessed this and took interest to their passionate fans because they see the profit, the clicks, social media engagement, and general interest they can get from their fans and the rest is history~",1,2019-05-11 05:15:14,aznidentity,t3_bj6xs4,t3_bj6xs4,en3b0m0,"0"

He'd be risking his business, his business' reputation in the area.

He doesn't gain anything by doing this unless.... the woman actually was stealing or trying to steal.

u/Kleinee,"OP, why do you have that ""term"" in your name? Dear god...

Overall, I do agree. It's so weird why they're censoring so many pro-Asian opinions, topics, and publications. I've given a listen and read to some of Plan A's content, and although I might not agree with everything, they're a pretty harmless normal bunch. I think it's great to hear a variety of opinions on different subject matters. 

Personally, I browse r/AA sometimes, but I don't have much desire to post there cuz everything is like, as OP said, so moderated. It's so glazed with this almost ""white liberal-ly"" narrative. I'm guessing the term for the Asian version some would use to describe it is 'boba American'? Asides from the fact that not a lot of compelling discussions take place there, it's like everything is pushing only for one particular direction in opinions. After following AA and this subreddit for a couple of months now, I like this subreddit better. There are extremist opinions sometimes but it's more entertaining here. There's more edgy stuff xD

It also irks me that they're filtering out Yang topics. The democrat establishment and their corporate goons in mainstream media are already shutting Yang out. The very last thing any Asian-American centered community needs is to censor discussion and/or not promote one of the few Asian American candidates running.",14,2019-08-29 04:02:50,aznidentity,t3_cwtv65,t3_cwtv65,eyfmwf2,"0"

u/hai594,"OP: It will not get easier when you graduate. Maybe less schooling stress but the immigration process is unpredictable, thanks to Donald. H1B takes 6-10 years ( longer for China , India) , companies can fire you anytime and may not sponsor your green card. They may be too small or too dumb to hire a good lawyer. I have known too many who got fucked by H1B (assuming they even reach that stage). I had HRs who didn't know how to do my tax. The best job in school for int students is tutoring - do well in a class and have the Prof recommendation.

I have been there too. Guys on this sub sometimes make fun of rich foreign kids and keeps saying that as an asian female it must be easy to survive in a foreign country. That's not even half the truth. My family is well off but my mother abuses me and my dad is out of the picture so I was pretty much on my own since the age of 16.

When I wanted to leave the abusive situation, I realized that I cannot be homeless under a student visa. I didn't even know how to drive. I could not get food stamps or government assistance. Most jobs at school were only for American FAFSA studebnts, cannot work off campus ( this is not the same in Canada, UK, Australia). By now I haven't been back to my home country for 10 years.

With the job discrimination from blacks, whites and constant passive aggressive from every race plus asian americans, I feel tired TBH.

Which ever nation that happens to be America's ""enemy"" of the week is subjected to biased media coverage. It's so insidious that communities today are *still* affected from their fearing mongering from 18 years ago, post-9/11, ie. Quebec City and Christchurch shootings. Yet they call the Chinese brainwashed? Ha! They've been bleating about ""Freedom^^^TM"", ""Democracy^^TM"", ""Liberation^^TM"" ever since the Cold War. 

If HK actually does join up with the US to fight a proxy war, then GG. I'm sure the Kurds and Saddam will say ""You too, eh?"" in the after life. And I'm talking worst case scenario should war come to fruition, I urge PoC to think about if your blood is so cheap that you would spill it for a White man's profit. I hope the answer is 'Fuck no!'.

with a total of 10751 comments, i wouldn't be surprised at \~14% being corona virus references. 

How many comments or percentage of all comments, by your definition, would be considered ""filled with racist comments""?

I agree, there are too many racist comments. I feel that one racist comment is 1 too many.

Please source your information and make your conclusive statements more accurately. Making claims to cultivate a sense of outrage from bad information does more harm than good. Look at how the Jussie Smolete incident did for gays, blacks, and trump opposition. Look at how women are treated as the cause of their own sexual assults instead of being treated as victims because so many false allegations were made.

in addition to those, she also spread a lot of misinformation about indonesia (and i can debunk every single one of her claims if you can read indonesian) in a way that makes indonesia looks soo backward compared to white countries. there are also multiple comments where she made derogatory remarks when it comes to indonesian.

u/[deleted],"It's never too late to start becoming more like us XD

On a more serious note, you're in your *20*s\*.\* That's incredibly early in your life - the first (on average) 25%. I haven't learned much simplified Chinese either so...(mainly due to concentration issues). For getting started, well everyone has their different ways of getting started. Go take a trip to China or something - Shanghai and Hangzhou especially are *absolutely beautiful* (on a good day/night). There's Chinese + English signs everywhere so if you know how to speak a bit of Chinese you should be fine. I mean one of the ways I started incorporating Chinese culture into my life was learning more about Chinese guns XD Yeah I know that technically isn't culture but eh. Learn more about your family history and connect with distant relatives and stuff over WeChat - that will probably help. If people think you're phony, who cares? Unless they're your boss or something their thoughts can't do shit to you.

So overall:

\- **Take a trip to China** (I went to China once when I was 12 (and I couldn't read Chinese, or speak it (except for cussing) ) - **best trip of my life** (though that could have been because my relatives were showering us with money :D). It really isn't that polluted (except Beijing!)

\- Track down long-lost relatives.

\- Def. get involved in your city's Asian-American communities even if you don't have much experience. I've found that having a ton of Asian friends really helps me feel more idk connected? With the Asian/Chinese part of me but that may be because we're really proud of our identity up here in the Northeast so...

\- Oh, nearly forgot! Go read famous ancient Chinese books (probably get the translated ones) and watch Chinese movies. I'd highly recommend *The Wandering Earth (流浪地球), Wolf Warrior 2 (战狼2),* those TV shows about Sun Wukong that literally every Chinese kid has watched in their childhood lol and Oh yes definitely read *The Three Kingdoms* *(三国演义) -* I love the strategy in it -  *Water Margin (水滸傳)* \- probably my favorite because it's about bandits and rebellions and stuff with fighting and strategy, and if you're more romance-y, *Dream of the Red Chamber (红楼梦).* Almost everyone in China knows these books and the characters in them, and many paintings, figures of speech, etc. reference those works. 

\- Other than that, good luck! A lot of people end up rejecting the Asian part of themselves (in my school we call 'em bananas - yellow on the outside, white on the inside) so you're quite lucky you didn't let it die out. It's quite the experience!

I as a Viet wouldn't feel any less connected towards an East Asian looking North East Indian than a Chinese, Korean, Cambodian etc.

Absolutely brother, its sad we didnt have the same understanding in the past but thanks to the internet and social media's our people are definitely getting more educated about it.Also the racism we all face now due to corona sorta does it too :(

&gt; I mean it seems like most of the North East of India is geographically closer to South East Asia (specifically Myanmar) than the motherland of India.

Oh north east has a very interesting history. It wasnt part of india till the brits pulled us in. Geographically, culturally, socially as well as emotionally :P , we have more in common with yall then India honestly ( No offense to the Indians just the truth)

&gt;Do you live in North East India? Or have you interacted with Native North East Indians?

Yup, i am a north easterner myself. 

&gt;If yes, do north east Indians have any affinity towards Mainland Indians?

Woah, Where do i start :P Hostility is present in both indians (specially North and West indians) and NE's for each other no denying that. They do not tolerate NE's on their lands and vice versa. So many reported and tragically even more under reported racist crimes committed from both sides. Its honestly fucked up and i cant blame either one of us. Like i said the brits got us in this mess xD. So to answer your question, majority of NE and the majority of north/west indians do hate each other but we kinda get on fantastically with the majority of south indians and east indians and a minority of north and west indians. So much minor- major :D

&gt;Do they feel closer to Eastern Asians (I've heard they do consume mostly east Asian entertainment)?
Or do they not give a fuck about either?

Oh absolutely, not just east but with southeast asians too. Like i said above we didnt in the past but we do now. Yes, they watch a lot of animes and east asian cinemas( I dont tho lol).",3,2020-05-14 19:42:02,aznidentity,t3_gj0ohn,t1_fqmli9z,fqmxt4i,"0"

It used to be solely about police brutality, but unfortunately, and duly, its platform has been overused and oversaturated with causes like LGBTQ, disabled blacks, undocumented blacks, convicted blacks, etc. Don't forget, too, that this year is an election year, which is why you see so much mainstream support.

My main issue with BLM is that it encourages the ""victim mentality"" among minorities, and has encouraged nonsensical things like the oppression Olympics and political correctness. Nowadays, there's a severe lack of pride in one's identity as a result of this mentality -- the goal of the game is to say ""i'm a \[insert minority\] queer immigrant amputee...i don't have to work at all since i suffer so much uwu...plz accept me Harvard and NASA otherwise you're a racist faggot"". 

Ultimately, the way us Asians (and minorities in general) are going to change America's rhetoric is not through complaining and victimizing ourselves, but slowly building our success, and protest where protest is needed. So disregarding the shady stuff around the movement, the message BLM has come to support is toxic for them and really for all minorities.",7,2020-06-25 06:20:50,aznidentity,t3_hfg32j,t3_hfg32j,fvxhh9a,"0"

u/[deleted],"&gt;People don't generally care about privacy in Asia. We're more concerned about our next rice bowl so to speak. Especially during pandemic times. If you notice, Asian countries are generally trust their governments more than Americans are. I first learned about the existence of Libertarian here in reddit.

Do you have sources on this? I mean, granted, I don't know too many poor Asian Asians (in either Taiwan or China), so in my experience this isn't true for the educated, middle class folks over there.

&gt;I think most Chinese citizens support this national security law. I'm not Chinese but I grew up under racial pogroms. 

Again, this is not my experience speaking to actual Chinese people. But, this is just my own experiences. However, I don't think we will ever be able to have academic papers on this topic precisely because there isn't the kind of freedom of speech that allows for that in China.

&gt;The situation in HK is not as black and white as it's made to be. Sure China has something to be blamed for too, but don't think these violent rioters are saints. They literally attacked people for speaking Mandarin. You probably can find their videos everywhere. I emphasise on the rioters as I think the peaceful protesters are within their rights to protest whatever their motives are.

You're telling me things I know and yet don't factor into the discussion here. I've never stated that things are black or white... in fact, my posts should pretty clearly indicate it's the black and white mentality that I find echoed in the OP (and if you look at other posts, all around) I dislike.

&gt;It's very very easy to stigmatise Chinese and China these days. 'Chicom' , Kung Flu, Chinese virus should be banned. I don't identify as China Chinese but I will not stand idly while they are being bullied to submission

I'm of Chinese heritage. I consider myself to be Taiwanese in that I identify with being Taiwanese, but I'm not someone that thinks I can deny my Chinese heritage (because imo Taiwan is still recently birthed from China and most of us are Han Chinese anyway ^^and ^^also ^^probably ^^my ^^family ^^being ^^KMT ^^probably ^^influences ^^how ^^I ^^think).

All this to say-- if the criticism here is about how language is used (in this case, saying ""fuck China""), then the same standard should apply to how we talk about it. Dismissing someone as a boba liberal is an easy way to blanket-cancel a person. 

I agree that terms like ""fuck China,"" ""fuck the CCP,"" etc.,[ is xenophobic language](https://old.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/grcsf1/vent_i_feel_more_and_more_sympathetic_to_the_ccp/fs0sckp/) that nonAsians hide behind [in order to spew their own racism in an acceptable manner.](https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwe4z3t/) It bothers me a lot.

My favorite sushi restaurant was closed due to the pandemic which is why my wife and I went to c-appy Bluewater Grill, which is basically just overpriced seafood Applebee’s. I’m not racist, my wife’s boyfriend is Asian. Please have some compassion for me, I spent many years in college only to become an insurance agent which doesn’t require any degree at all. I also lost all my savings trading options on $NKLA courtesy of /r/wallstreetbets on Reddit. I have acid reflux and shart my khaki shorts constantly. I also love anime and my favorite one is Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures. I am a Tier 3 sub and simp for Pokimane, as well as a sub to Belle Delphine’s onlyfans account.

 I get where he's coming from. Do you know how shitty he must have felt to have written such a deprecating post? Thing is, fuck trying to fit in with THEM. Why put them on a pedestal. Proves he's brainwashed. Accept that they're not better than you, you don't need them in your life. You don't need ""white"" parties...lol. For what? The girls? 

Here's a little secret: if you want something you won't get it because it fucks with your head which leads to beta actions. You'll get the girls who you place lowest. So if you want Asian girls, rank them lowest, lol. Life tip works in other areas too such as competitions, but esp for women.

Come on, if you got game, you realize this non-sense partying crap. Practice and you'll get girls of any race easily when you just go places. Only losers digging their own grave go for girls at bars and clubs or parties... lol i laugh so hard at these guys flaunting used vaginas they just get lucky or pitied into who are not attractive because party girls all look the same: average but tons of makeup and whoredom to compensate the fact that can't ever compete with the true beauties... my logic for those loose thotts is I can just pay for that and be done with it :D

 Especially these days when their men are pu$$ies in looks and personality... lol. The problem you should be having is you're attracting so many girls... who should you choose...as an Asian male. See that? I place myself above all the rest. I don't show it for obvious reasons, but to get girls? Without that your confidence will be limited. Without confidence you might as well cut off your balls.

You gotta value yourself. The fact that you're ashamed and think Asians need to be invited to parties or network with other races so bad means you got a looooong waays to go my friend. Make them come to you by not giving a shit about them or their people. Know you are better than their weak druggie men, or any other race, in bed to their women...and act it...trust me practice 3 months each day cold approach on the streets learn to be confident look in their eyes and game up. You'll be laughing at your self how easy it is... after a while u just get tired of all the fucking...then it becomes err...a problem, lol.

know this: asian males are hot n in style now..and from now probbly will forever... Here's a confidence booster. AM/XF couples are the BEST in dynamics and genuine attraction. I lived in big ass cities such as nyc, the burbs, and rural areas many many years vast experience shows me wm/wf couples suck, ends up broken and messed up the most, white guys and gals cant control their emotions drink like crazy etc and shit hits the fan early. proven by all the white milfs who crave asian both emotionally and physically, lol. bm/wf contrary to what bullshit hollowood agenda preaches are terrible, where in real life black men get the dreg fat and ugggggghly white whale or crackhead white chicks that no man wants out of desperation, lol strut around all proud in trash neighborhoods (elite towns will have none of that) until a real Asian man white female couple shows up then the girl gets embarassed af crawls back together into their dens. Asian males have it the best. A well put together Alpha Asian is the MOST desirable from ALL races. Drop the ghetto thug crap. I've seen guys try this and it doesn't work. It works for dregs and dross. If u wanna be second fiddle to black men or deadbeater latino for those raactchet baby mommas  strolling around walmart it may work...for a while..but you're FUCKING ASIAN ALPHA MALE THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE. The elite women of all races especially white ie. Ivy grad, CEO, board level, good stock, family, of course beautiful face and body, morals will NEVER even consider degenerate shit from that culture. Wake up its a big world, aim for the best, not crap on TV or bullshit youtube faker dregs. Im saying this unequivolcally cause lets just say...i had to climb up the ranks...What the media shows and your dinky little highschool culture shows is far far far from reality. XD

Asian male/x females are the best. It's most ""NORMAL"" meaning mutual respect and appreciation and potential to last longest...if that's your thing. It really comes down i think to the rarest is the best and most desirable law. More common is shit. Most common white male/white female. Next white male/asian female. Then black/white , then rarest of all is asian male/white female.  hate to say it but asian male wf does better than am/af in THIS social climate. Different elsewhere! elsewhere am/af does well too but NOT IN USA (i don't need to explain why here XD)

STOP putting them on a pedestal that's what 99.9999% of losers do till they fuckin die and the world doesn't give a shit about all of them. Hit the gym and work on personality and practice. DONT LET FAILURE AFFECT YOU - that's key. Btw That's an advanced thing to master. You will fail its just a part of life even if you are the biggest pro. I argue that the best pros fail more, BUT the difference is the true masters of women NEVER let a rejection or set back get to them. They will LAUGH and crack a joke at themselves and ERASE that failure, then in a blink of an eye find another target, rinse repeat until they are rewarded with the unmatched dopamine release of a win or multiple wins at once. all this can happen within... 15-20 minutes. I treat this more importantly than my workouts. Once you get this reward, it can propel your good feels for weeks...imagine getting this though...100x PER DAY...

u/bortalizer93,"i don't have any defense *if* it was true.

the problem is, the legitimacy of that claim is up in the air.

the main claim to this is the hadist written by hisham ibn urwah, which writings after he moved to iraq when he was 71 years old was questioned in legitimacy, notably by tahzib al'tahzib; who mentioned that other islamic scholars who lived in madina at the time, including malik ibn anas, never mentioned this. furthermore, mizanul itidal; the book that chronicled the writers of hadists; said that hisham ibn urwah's memory greatly deteriorates as he grew older.

another claim to this is by al-tabari which said that aisha is *betrothed* when she was 7. however, we also need to note that it is on the record that the betrothal happened in 620 AD. on the other hand, al-tabari also written that all the child of abu bakr (the father of aisyah) was born in the jahiliyah era, which was years before 610 AD when abu bakr converted to islam. this mean al-tabari wrote conflicting testimony on the account, and/or aisha was much older during the bethrotal.

there's also account by ibn hajar al-asqalani, which wrote that asma, aisyah eldest sister who was 10 years older than aisha, died at 100 years old at 73 or 74 hijri (around 692 AD). if asma was 100 years at 692 AD, it means she's 28 during aisha betrothal. that means aisha was *at least* 18 in 620 AD (i say at least because converting hijriya to gregorian year is kinda hard for me). which if we combined with al-tabari statements that say all of abu-bakr children was born during jahiliyah period, that further proves that aisha was much older during the bethrotal.

as you can see, it's a complicated claim that dates back for millennials. now; we can keep arguing about it like some kind of armchair expert on arabic ancient history, or just take the good stuffs and leave the bad stuffs; like literally every religion on the planet. or heck, even recent atheism. ^^^and ^^^dat ^^^gorilla ^^^grip ^^^pussy ^^^tho",10,2020-10-27 08:20:52,aznidentity,t3_jiv8mc,t1_ga94eyf,ga95z05,"0"

***What is the difference between forced reeducation camps and concentration camps?***

""forced"" reeducation camps will ""force"" the uighurs to distantiate themselves with those opposed to Allah words like the extremists of ETIM (who are distorting the *Quran religious text* by the way) and inciting to kill all infidels, as I mentioned earlier. The vocational centres are then ""forcing"" the muslim uighurs children to go to school like hundred millions other kids in China, while at the same time ""forcing"" the uighur adults to learn a skill in order to be competent and find a job later on, like the other 1 billion people in the country.

Define what you mean by concentration camp, once again you are repeating what CNN, BBC News have taught you. I remember there was an American guy accusing Islam to be a religion preaching hate, he said that he saw it on the TV from Fox News. When I told him it was wrong to make such conclusion, he then asked me: *""What is the difference between a regular muslim and Daesh anyway?""*

Eventually, that's the power of Western media. Brainwashing the mass population, and we are all victim even in an unconscious level.

***I've seen the videos of regular Uyghurs(not terrorists, regular people) with bags over their heads and tied to chains..***

Was it from this video? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C83eSHHG4vk&amp;ab\_channel=numuves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C83eSHHG4vk&amp;ab_channel=numuves)

Those are regular Uighurs. Go to Xinjiang and see by yourself how many of them are ""abused"", or perhaps save your plane ticket and simply trust what BBC News are telling you.

***Also it does not matter what the underlying problems were, they took entire communities and sent to them their reeducation camps..***

When the Americans told the world in 2003 that IRAQ had Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), people were sh\*t scared and thought that the Muslims were going to overtake the world. Not only it was a pure fabrication by the US government, but after the invasion of IRAQ the muslim diaspora has seen a brother getting humiliated and weakened.

When the American is telling the world in 2020 that CHINA has several concentration camps oppressing Muslims, people are sh\*t scared and think that Uighurs are being exterminated. Somehow, people don't learn from History.

***Unless they are saying that every single Uyghur is a terrorist..***

Do you really believe your statement?

***Also all there figures about unemployment come solely from the CCP. They were released after the fact. I do not believe them one bit..***

You don't believe CCP, fair enough. Yet you are putting your truth into Western funded media which all claim to be ""Chinese experts"" as much as they used to be ""Muslim experts"" when they needed to exploit oil in the Middle East.

***Also they are still being jailed. It hasn't stopped. It hasn't been shut down. It's an ongoing issue..***

Just think one second bro', do you really think China is dumb enough to pick on random uyghur people exclusively? for what purpose, for fun? wasting tax money of 1.4B to jail some folks in Xinjiang just to flex their power?

YES people are jailed, and among them are Han Chinese, Mongolians, Uyghurs, Hui Chinese, Miao Chinese, Korean, miscellaneous Chinese ethnics etc. if they commit a crime, which is the procedure done in literally every country in the world such as Japan, India, Pakistan, Germany, Spain, South Africa, Norway, Brazil, Australia, Bangladesh, Algeria, France, South Korea, Vietnam and so on.

Last but not least:

If CCP wants to wipe out the Uighurs, they need to do the following things:

1. Forbid the Uighurs to have multiple kids
2. Force them to learn Mandarin and ban Uighur language
3. Not giving them higher education so they stay in the lower class

But, China has done exactly the opposite:

1. According to Chinese laws, Uighur parents can have more than one kid whereas the Han Chinese parents used to be allowed to have only one kid
2. Uighurs are constantly exposed to their own language and there is no law forbidding them to speak their mother tongue
3. Uighurs, like other minorities in China, get bonus points on their college entrance marks and are protected under the ""Ethnic Law and Minority Rights""

So, China clearly did a terrible job if they truly wanted to wipe out the Uighurs because the population in XinJiang has more than doubled now XD",4,2020-10-30 10:02:48,aznidentity,t3_jki39w,t1_gal15de,gal3wes,"0"

u/[deleted],"&gt;Have you encountered people like this?

Online?  Constantly.  In real life, I used to run into them all the time in high school and the short time I went to college.  I actually went through a period of downplaying my Japanese heritage and identifying more with my Lao side despite the fact that I know nothing about Laos because people would get so weird when they found out I was Japanese.  I appreciate the fact that they're interested in Japan and Japanese culture but they take it to a weird level, to the point where it's almost infantilizing.

For example, Japan has a really fucked up recent history.  If you're Asian, Japan probably committed some type of atrocity in your country.  The Japanese right wing is still like this.  They deny atrocities and want to change the constitution so Japan can go back to committing them.  The right wing government oppresses minority groups, creating a lot of social, political and criminal issues for them.  The Japanese government almost seems to hate women and gay people.  I love Japan but it can be a terrible place to live for some groups of people.  But western weebs will either not take the time to learn about these things or go ""but they don't know any better uwu"".  The ""they don't know any better"" line pisses me off the most because on one hand, it's giving the Japanese right a pass to keep up this behavior, and on the other hand, it's lowkey saying that Japanese people are too stupid to know right from wrong.

Then you have right wing western weebs who know how fucked up Japan can be and love that about the country, then pull the ""they don't know any better"" or ""it's the Koreans/Chinese behind this"" excuse out of their ass whenever Japanese leftists get some attention for engaging in left wing politics.  Some anti racism, anti xenophobia march happens in Japan and they'll go ""but they're Japanese, they don't really understand what they're marching about!  They know nothing about racism!""  I assure you they do.  They may not have a great understanding of American racism.  No one but Americans understand this goofy shit.  But Japanese people know what they're doing, whether it's good or bad.",1,2021-01-08 01:48:30,aznidentity,t3_ksqn61,t3_ksqn61,giht2s8,"0"

Frantz Fanon was a Marxist-Leninist, whose theoretical breakthrough consisted of proving how people of color have been “proletarianized” by Western European and American colonialism and imperialism, meaning there’s more in common between us due to shared histories of oppression by global white supremacy, than there are cultural differences.  He coined the term “People of Color” to reflect this fact, and promote solidarity between nonwhites, particularly Africans and Asians, who he saw as natural allies.

u/jcbc11112,"I think so. Probably slightly less than I do but still, yes.

Koreans are generally pessimistic, and, for the lack of a better word, kinda blackpilled culturally. In the sense that we realize that just studying hard and ""being nice and having a good personality UwU"" shit that America likes to promote just doesn't cut it when it comes to success, especially as a minority man in the West. So my parents really forced me from a young age to learn how to groom myself, be fashion-forward, work out and do school sports, be ""interesting"" and take on different hobbies, in addition to doing well in school. 

I know Koreans' overemphasis on appearance gets a bad rep, but I genuinely think in the long run, my parents putting pressure on me to look good was beneficial. And no, before someone inevitably asks, my parents never pushed me to get plastic surgery. They were always super affirming about my features and made sure I was a proud Korean and yadda yadda. I know personal grooming is something a lot of men have to teach themselves (especially in America, Jesus so many men put in 0 effort), so I'm glad that it was instilled in me from childhood.

It also helped that my dad is a conventionally attractive person (this isn't me bragging, I honestly wish I looked half as good as him) who continues to take personal grooming and staying fit very seriously even at the age of 52 now, so he was always someone I could look up to as a role model. He's very sociable, commands respect and attention, extroverted, loves traveling and taking up different hobbies. If a woman flirted with him he'd flirt right back (not in like a let's fuck way, in a very clearly joking way lol), and this was all despite his language barrier. So I've always been very inspired by him.

When we lived in a very white town, my mom also used to help with the other school moms doing fundraisers and setting up snack tables during field day and shit like that, and she's told me she could always tell that the other (white) school moms would be cliquey as hell and clearly look down on her. I mean, now she has a great group of other Korean friends and some random Dominican friends from work, but she has no delusion that all the niceties white people engage in are fake AF.

Again, they don't know the ins and outs of everything but I actually do talk about this shit with my parents, and they take me seriously whenever we have these discussions because they value my thoughts and opinions.",17,2021-06-07 03:25:17,aznidentity,t3_nu1jka,t3_nu1jka,h0vbzkw,"0"

yeah lol it's the only sport I really care a lot about. I like MMA too, but just not as much. I ain't no DCAF XD

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; think Puerto Ricans might be done with boxing given how there hasn't been a Cotto/Trinidad for a while. 

The big hope right now seems to be Berlanga, but I don't think he's as good as advertised. I know his promoters seem to want him to face Canelo in the next couple years (get the big Mexico vs PR rivalry kicking again), but I just don't see Berlanga being a serious player in the division.

&gt;But I'd include the UK too, they seem big on boxing and they've produced some decent fighters.

tru

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Possibly, but UFC just markets MMA so much better. I would prefer to watch boxing over MMA like 90% of the time, but nowadays I am always watching MMA over boxing and not by choice. There's not very many good cards, promoters love to marinate fights and boxers are beating up ex world champs/journeymen and comparing who beat them better vs actually fighting each other. I'd rather watch MMA champions fight vs a boxing card headlined by some prospect 5+ fights out from fighting for a title. 

Same. I think the boxing fanbase has a hard time admitting it but hte UFC came out of COVID a big winner, and they've shown a model that's very easy for casual fans to follow. No need to buy Ring magazine to understand the rankings or wait years for a fight, they just force it to happen. The closest equivalent I can think of in boxing is PBC, but PBC hasn't reached anywhere near the level of talent consolidation that the UFC has (there was the WBSS too, but that seems to have run into some financial issues). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Feels like the main reason for the resurgence of boxing is due to a large demographic shift as younger Americans are more likely to be Hispanic American.

oh absolutely. We're basically the cornerstone of the sport market at this point. The African American population still has some residual fans and a lot of talents, but it feels like interest is declining there towards football and basketball. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ahh yeah you're talking about Dat Ngyuen. It definitely was not a race thing (even though some people here would believe it) but that's how boxing works. Promoters take losses on everyone they sign hoping that one of the people they sign brings in the money. If Dat was like 15 years younger and had more potential I think he wouldn't have gotten blacklisted the way he did, but IIRC he was like 36 when he won so they wouldn't have gotten their $$ out of him. It's pretty sad but boxers are just treated like race horses pretty much.

yeah that's who I was thinking of. It sucks man, the sport is run by such a bunch of parasites. They just throw the guys under the bus and leave them to misery. That's why I never blame guys like Ward or Mikey Garcia or Beterbiev when they sit out in their careers over promotional disputes. They know the guys running the show don't care about them.",2,2021-08-26 15:34:12,aznidentity,t3_pauck0,t1_hac9g7c,hafouwk,"0"
u/bleer95,"&gt;Me neither. No knock on him but usually when a fighter scores a bunch of first round knockouts they tend to develop bad habits that get exploited later on in their career.

same, plus I think his chin might be a bit suspect

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PBC is okay. They are not as good as promotion but they do a much better job than Top Rank for sure. Unfortunately Top Rank has a really good stable and in certain divisions holds better fighters than PBC. I think you can make an argument that Bellator has some good fighters too compared to the UFC, but they're few and far inbetween.

yeah agreed. I just like PBC because its the closest in terms of talent consolidation boxing has to hte UFC and they make good fights happen, unlike Top Rank where they're basically milking a few fighters dry. I agree Bellator is good competition to the UFC, but still, the UFC has an average of like 80% of each division's top 15, it's not a fair fight.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Haha pretty much. A lot of Filipinos too but they are more fairweather and seem to watch only Filipino boxers.

hahaha true. I think part of that is that Pac cast such a long shadow that a lot of other talented Filipino fighters never really got much exposure. Nobody really knew who Viloria or Nietes were even though they are/were elite fighters at hteir peak. Donaire is hte only other guy who really got a profile, and the younger talents like Gaballo, Casimero and Ancajas basically don't exist in the public eye.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Black boxing fans feel like they're going the way of old Italian boxing fans back in the day. Elitist and talking about how modern fighters wouldn't measure up to the boxing greats. Reminds me of that scene in Coming to America where the old Italian guy talks about how great Marciano was lmao. No one's denying the greatness of black boxers (except Floyd I guess because people don't like him) but they definitely don't give much respect to non black boxers.

I feel like the fighters give respect, but the fans do get very defensive. But that is a pretty good analogy. I guess part of that is DBN brainpoisoning XD

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yup. I don't blame guys like Mikey but they actually have leverage. They're championship level boxers that have a fanbase. Unfortunately for people like Dat or boxers of his caliber (basically guys that are journeymen/gatekeepers who could potentially be in title contention) have 0 leverage. It's crazy that on Boxrec you can see guys with good records just fall off and you always wonder what happened to them lol.

u/CIAInformer,"&gt;plus I think his chin might be a bit suspect

Definitely.  Like I said if you are getting 1st round KOs like no ones business there tends to be defensive lapses that form.  If your chin is in any way suspect like Berlanga you're fucked when you're fighting someone like Canelo.

&gt;UFC has an average of like 80% of each division's top 15, it's not a fair fight.

Yup, and that's how they keep making the best fights.  

&gt;unlike Top Rank where they're basically milking a few fighters dry.

At this point, given Top Rank's business model I don't really know if they have any other choice.  Their stable is getting smaller, all the Mikey Garcia/Pacquaio/Crawford comments/lawsuits have kinda incentivized newer boxers to not want to sign with them.  They just keep doing in house fights/fights with lower level promoters because if they lose one of their golden gooses it could be all over for them.  Golden Boy went from arguably the 2nd largest promoter to basically a regional level promoter after they lost Canelo.

&gt;Donaire is hte only other guy who really got a profile, and the younger talents like Gaballo, Casimero and Ancajas basically don't exist in the public eye.

Yup, like I said most Filipinos are fairweather and only like Pacquiao.  I love Donaire but even he's got that shadow cast on him lol.  It's kinda funny you mention Gaballo and Ancajas too, because they are even promoted by Manny Pacquiao lol!  The man promotes them and they still get no attention.

&gt;I guess part of that is DBN brainpoisoning XD

u/lilaku,"so i will be upfront and say that all the research i'm doing is self guided, which is a bit spontaneous and sporadic; with a lot of it initiated by just google, wiki+reference sources. currently much of my effort is directed towards warring states period (latter/eastern zhou) philosophy, with my main focus on daoism; i'm using [https://ctext.org/](https://ctext.org/) as it's an amazing free resource to many classical text -- only a small portion of this database is translated to english; the rest is all in classical or literary chinese (which is also part of my self guided attempt at language acquisition)

\---------

as far as matriarchy specifically, a lot of work still needs to be done in pre-zhou period because there's much less archeological evidence and even less textual; and there's still a lot of contentious debate about sex and gender roles in the various neolithic chinese cultures (there are many, spread all over geographically)

it's also not an area i've really dug too deep on, but i do know the beginning of zhou dynasty was when we really start seeing text that start to really define gender roles in text, which confucian scholars really stressed upon during latter periods

my hypothesis is that this was an attempt to correct the failings of the previous shang dynasty (not so much surviving text outside of oracle bones) -- this was a very common practice successive dynasties did as to not repeat the mistakes they think attributed to the fall of dynasties past; i don't have strong evidence to support this, as it's not my area of study

archeologists have found one intact tomb back in the 70s belonging to lady Fu Hao (婦好) dating back to shang dynasty (preceding zhou); i can't find the scholarly article i read about her again &gt;\_&lt; but a simple google will tell you that she a fierce military general that lead many successful campaigns in expanding shang territories at the zenith of shang's power

she was a favorited consort of the king of shang (the title of emperor didn't come into being until qin over a millennia later), though not his main wife/queen. she was also a high priestess who led ritualistic and divination ceremonies, which was also a huge position of power and influence. i remember reading that some suggest she had many many lovers, both men and women, outside of her marriage to shang king, but i'm having trouble finding that info now without the original paper i read &gt;\_&lt; will post if i find it

a lot of info about her are all pieced together from various oracle bones inscriptions (ritual divination reading with results marked), there wasn't like any single tapestry that narrated her life or accomplishments, but it was clear she was the top dog, and even famous (male) generals of shang answered to her

perhaps early zhou rulers feared someone like her? this is just my conjecture based on what i've personally uncovered on my own

\---------

i'm going to skip right to tang dynasty (618 - 907ce), because that's the only period of imperial chinese history where we see a much more relaxed view of gender roles compared to any other imperial dynasty. there's something about the matrilineal ancestry of Li family that founded tang that i need to look into -- i believe it was their xianbei 鮮卑 ancestry which appears to be less patriarchal than post zhou-china

regardless, i'm sure having a warrior princess acknowledged as one of the four founding members of the dynasty is super empowering for women during the tang dynasty; you can find info about princess Pingyang pretty easily if you just want to start studying chinese history. here's a decent youtube primer on her: [https://youtu.be/Nt-nqgXoiM8](https://youtu.be/Nt-nqgXoiM8)

there's also a lot text and documentaries on the only female emperor of china, Wu Zetian 武則天; lots of latter song dynasty scholars (neoconfucius/anti-feminist) would paint her in a negative light, and she was recorded to doing some pretty ruthless things to maintain power (court intrigue and factionalism lies in the heart of all imperial chinese dynasties), but many historians argue tang might not of reached its golden age height without a lot of the policies she enacted. she was a very capable and pretty progressive leader, and it's thanks to her that commoners get to take the bureaucratic exams to become government officials, widening the talent pool of the country; this improvement to the meritocracy proved very beneficial for song dynasty (and later), ironically enough

\---------

the last thing i feel like i must bring up is that chinese had a more wholistic view of the person; nowadays, we see men, particularly of western thought, who are extremely fearful of exhibiting any feminine qualities for the fear of judgement and ridicule

chinese thought is that every person should have a good balance of masculine and feminine qualities to be whole and complete -- part of that comes from the school of yinyang 陰陽 which was later incorporated into daoist school of thought

also not to mention sex and sexuality! holy shit are the chinese gay af by our standards: i'm just gonna link [this episode](https://www.historyisgaypodcast.com/listen/2018/2/4/episode-3) from the history is gay podcast and their notes with their sources can be found [here](https://www.historyisgaypodcast.com/notes/2018/2/4/episode-3) (it's weird that they don't directly link the notes from the actual episode page; also be warned that there's a lot of old nsfw chinese art at the bottom of the notes page)

\---------

i'm sorry i can't really provide many other direct reading material as much of my focused study at this time is on character retention and authentic reading and understanding of classical chinese philosophy from the spring and autumn / warring states period as much of the thought that came from this period is the foundational ground for imperial chinese dynasties following it

where to start looking for info is tough without a framework or structure built around supplying that info, and i'm a fairly disorganized person, but i did start by taking mooc's from [edx.org](https://edx.org) on chinese history with harvardx's chinax series. that lead through through a series of different rabbit holes that i'm currently still digging on my own time XD i hope this was helpful .\_. if not, i'm sorry for making you read this giant wall o' text",4,2021-09-23 14:47:23,aznidentity,t3_psv5rz,t1_hdxar93,hdyxcqa,"0"

If this post was too ""mean"" or not sugarcoated enough for you, well that's not my problem. I've written meaner ones lol

My post wasn't actually trying to demonize AF at all, I was really directing it at Aaron Mok, the dumbass who wrote that Slate article. I was roasting boba liberals, I'm pretty sure they're both female and male. 

I also teased Simu Liu a bit, and also linked that hilarious article about that dude who tried to cancel Liu but then got canceled himself lmfao

I only ""give credit where credit is due"" to anyone who doesn't throw Asians under the bus, thanks very much. I have had numerous posts and comments where I roast cringeworthy Asian men. I even did it here.

I also wrote a post [earlier](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/q7fbxd/kdramas_cured_my_prejudice_what_another_asians/) mentioning how AsianTwoX (mostly AF in that sub right?) was roasting the author of that article.

Also, just remember no race of women date out as much as Af. You don't have to simp so hard for a group that doesn't reciprocate as much for you. You incorrectly give too much credit to a demographic (western AF) that didn't really do as much as you're claiming in your white knighting LOL. Hope you don't expect every AM to be as soft or AF-loyalist as you.

u/the_C_Atheist,"Excellent observation. That's why I keep saying WMAF is stigmatized because it's ASSUMED that if an Asian woman is with a white guy, she lowered the bar. I have said before it's like affirmative action - YOU personally may not be a shitty white guy with a really awful personality, but it's kind of assumed to be the case because Asian women are the only ones willing to give them a chance. So if you're a white guy, getting an Asian gf is like shooting fish in a barrell. I think guys like Laowhy and Serpentza know this, and that's why they're always so DEFENSIVE about their relationships, insisting that they are genuine. Whereas if you're an African or Indian guy with an East Asian gf, you must be an outstanding person because you've managed to overcome the deck that has been stacked against you.

But you know wot the irony is? SHE (the Asian woman who settles for a dweeby unimpressive WM) may look at marrying a white bloke as marrying up, but HE looks at it as marrying DOWN. You know what I mean? The fact of the matter is that for most trad con white dudes, their preference is always going to be the blonde Nordic type. (look at the dating preferences of most successful trad con white men) But since Marilyn won't give misogynistic red pill incels the time of day, and is busy 'banging Chad', they declare they're boycotting Western WAHmen, and declare they are date Asian. But deep in their hearts, if Marilyn did give them the time of day, they would fly the coop.

Anyway, since you view Europeans as this weird monolithic group of people, or people with a centralized identity that all share the same culture, same language, the same everything is just pure stupidity in itself.

And, clearly shows your pure ignorance of basic history. Anyway, I guess the groups from the following sub-ethnic groups like Germanics, Slavs, Baltics, Finno-Uralics, Romance, Italic, are all just the same am I right?

Historically speaking, the most opposed groups in Europe were Illyrians, Slavs, Baltics, Finno-Uralics, Romance groups that were the most oppressed historically.

For example, Anglo-Germanic hated and disliked Slavs and wanted to ethnically cleanse them out of existence, or Germanize them.

What about Ukrainians that died under the hands of Josef Stalin who was Georgian ethnically speaking.

&gt;rape of Vietnam is something most of your pinks don’t know about or knowing that agent orenge killed hundreds more innocent people because your government refuse to acknowledge it’s wrong doing.

Anyway, I really enjoyed how you tried the play the classical white guilt card towards me thinking, ""Oh, I'm some typical western white anglo American"".

Honestly, like what the fuck are you on about pal? I'm from Croatia and my government had nothing to do with it.

In fact, it's mostly Anglo-Germanic people's that done the most damage to it. Not Illyrians.

Let me guess, you are gonna use the white guilt tactic on me, and make me feel bad for what happened.

I guess **Illyrians (South Slavs)** i.e us Croats, and Bosnians are somehow responsible for what happened. Okay, xD pal give me a break here. Plus, If you are trying to apply this weird tactic to Eastern &amp; Balkan Europeans. In actual reality, you don't have much of a leg to stand on based on history alone.

&gt;Not when you kill one of our own. I hear hundreds of story of your kind killing Asian for not acting submissive the way you see us.

Again? Like what the fuck are you on about? Again, I'll repeat myself since you have very poor reading skills. None of your arguments even remotely applies to Eastern Europeans? Expect maybe Russia.

Anyway, you seem to fail what, I'm saying about free love. All I'm saying, in a nutshell, is this what business is of yours on what two grown adults do.",-1,2021-10-31 07:37:56,aznidentity,t3_qirlwz,t1_hiqgidt,hiqo2a2,"0"
u/Designer-Story-7567,"&gt;You can’t tell the difference between one Asian with another Asian so all of us are put into one group. It’s only fitting to do the same with you (Croatia is part of western world) by putting you with the other white country

Please, explain how Croatia is part of the western world despite showing different history, and values. 

For example, a lot of us Croats are descended from Illyrians and have more native Balkan DNA than Slavic.

You really are an ignorant person you know that right? What's next is Albania, and Serbia is part of the western world xD 

Also, having a preference for someone, or attraction is biology and environment in reality. 

If, I walk up to someone and offer to suck the dick that's somehow oppressing them.   


&gt;You can’t tell the difference between one Asian with another Asian so all of us are put into one group. It’s only fitting to do the same with you (Croatia is part of western world) by putting you with the other white country

Actually, it's pretty easy based on language, culture, behavior, facial structure, dress codes, social norms. If you have some basic knowledge of it. 

&gt;comment section talking about fetishizing Asian any Asian as long as they look Asian.

So, having a simple preference, or finding a different group of people attractive is wrong, and no one should date, marry, or even together with someone of a different group. 

You sir are an racist plain and simple. What's wrong with interracial relationships? I wouldn't have a problem if a black person choose to date, my sister. 

But, judging from your response alone. I'll say you are just a racist who hates anyone who ""dates"" outside of their own race. 

I bet all my money in my bank account right that if your daughter/son brought home a non-Asian person, which could be anyone really you would flip the fuck out and get bitter because they didn't choose an Asian person.",0,2021-10-31 09:57:24,aznidentity,t3_qirlwz,t1_hiquxc9,hiqxs4f,"0"

u/ChineseGoldenAge,"\- Wicker Park is a party neighborhood. There a strip with just like Las Vegas where all the bars, clubs, and smoking shops are at. The bars, clubs, and smoking shops can be OUTSIDE your apartment depending on where you live in Wicker Park. That place has MULTIPLE smoking shops (that sell weed, vapes, cigars...etc.). That place is also near a few grocery stores, as well as restaurants like angry crab, and Korean BBQ. Wicker park is literally a place that doesn't sleep on Friday and Saturday night due to the bars, clubs, smoking shops. A place with few crimes also. This place is cheaper than Lincoln Park, but more expensive than Lakeview.

\- Lakeview, I don't know much about this place. I went to the Lakeview high school here. Let me think, this is what I can pull up: [https://www.choosechicago.com/neighborhoods/lakeview/](https://www.choosechicago.com/neighborhoods/lakeview/). It's famous for its theaters and arts and the sports stadium, Wrigley field. The apartments, condos and houses here are cheaper than wicker park and Lincoln park.

\- Lincoln Park = there's a zoo, butterfly house, and plant house, a few bars, and clubs near the neighborhood. Lots of restaurants here. The beach and biking trail are also near Lincoln Park. This place have a huge grassy fields where you can play recreational activities like sports, have picnics...etc. There's lots of grocery places in Lincoln Park. You're also 45 minutes away (biking distance) to the famous downtown here where there's even MORE shops, MORE stores, MORE of everything.  It's safe to live here because.... well...it's expensive. Can be very expensive as this is the place where a lot of people including rich college students and rich people live. The most expensive neighborhood compared to the other two.

Funny because near North of Lincoln Park is also an even more expensive neighborhood.... Gold Coast where you got houses going for 1 million+ XD.

I would choose Wicker Park or Lincoln Park (if I have money). But it also depends where you work and where you going to school dictate your choices in choosing a location.",3,2021-11-11 08:24:11,aznidentity,t3_qr63ku,t1_hk6e6o3,hk6ijm1,"0"

u/artrockenthusiast,"No idea, but today’s twenty-somethings, while all their English media is just reinventions of itself every five minutes and they’ve just moved from fetishising Japanese people to Korean people, at the same time, many of them are just not working because a job doesn’t mean you can make a living anymore. In fact, above generations have a whole *class* of working homeless people. And there are becoming labour shortages because of that. Because there’s no reason to  work in thankless, physically hazardous, and toxic environments because you’ll *still* live with your parents. Shoot, I know a guy with a literal PhD who commutes from two or three counties away. I live in a dilapidated one room apartment (two, if you count the bathroom, thankfully) with my life in storage, it’s the cheapest game in town outside of the far out parts that I call “shoot-you-in-the-face-in-broad-daylight-ville” (ALPOC are in danger in way more places than either group of “ReAl PeOpLe uwu”) because that actually happens out those ways (One’s Neo-Nazis, the other’s bl@ck separatists) and it costs half my salary. And if put hourly, 20$/hr before deductions. And deductions are honestly not a terrible amount. My life should not be sitting in a storage shed. 

And again, many people like me, if not for this one exact building, many people live in their cars or in shelters with jobs. I should know—I’ve been working with the homeless for 17 years! 

A 2LDK today costs just slightly more than a month’s worth of my pay. I’m significantly over minimum wage. Even minimum wage, which the US is so exploitative it *needed* a law for that, was made so a man could support a nuclear family comfortably. It’s been slipping—to live the picket fence dream in the ‘90s, you’d need either dad/breadwinner making significant over minimum or both parents working to do the same. Ignore nominal money value, if adjusted for ‘90s nominal value, I would be living amazingly well. Now? Pfft. 

THAT is actually what I think is gonna tip everything over. As long as your intentionally kept dumb populace (Ikegami Akira has some really good stuff to say about making easily controlled populace by limiting access to books—you know how bookstores keep vanishing?—and stigmatising intelligence. Absolutely recommend, but I don’t think he’s ever been translated. But for anyone that could read, big recommend) is kept busy with shiny budget gadgets, taxing job that pays for them and for a place to live, and giving them a demograph of people to bash, you can take anything that’s not nailed down. 

But when you make it impossible for those people yo not only kit themselves out in shiny new junk that compensates for the fact they can’t read and fact-check whatever drivel they’re being fed themselves, but have two jobs and split an apartment with all their siblings at 58? Or can’t move out at all at 29, even with a PhD? 

THAT is why I think this will collapse.",1,2021-11-17 03:13:17,aznidentity,t3_qssxie,t1_hkxeunm,hkxxd3r,"0"

seriously, why are you guys from r/tall like this? You sound like you guys have a massive chip on your shoulder, Did you lose your gf to an asian guy after she got into kpop or something?

edit: shit, your post is packed with so much misinformation. you mentioned the difference in heights between korean men and dutch men was greater than between men and women. but then i checked it and the difference is:

1. between white men and white women: 5 inches
2. between korean men at 5""8 (now 5""9) and dutch men at 5""11: 3 inches

what the fuck are you trying to play here? do you have a math problem or something? oh of course you do, you are w\*\*\*e. you probably aren't very tall yourself, probably only 5""8 but larping to be 6""6 white guy because you got 175 cm and 215 cm mixed up XD",4,2021-11-19 02:22:05,aznidentity,t3_qwde8u,t1_hl7683k,hl7bmt6,"0"

u/got2shit,"From my experience of travel all over the U.S., (throughout my teen and adult life): in a very homogenous, rural area where there are only White Americans there is a lot of discrimination (whether out of curiosity or prejudice) and most WFs would consider an AM as more of a novelty, one-night stand kind of thing; in places closer to the big cities where there is more diversity people are usually more open and if you bring up race people don't have much to say and act ""color-blind""; in the bigger cities and university towns with a greater minority population, the dating scene for AM (for me) isn't a big issue unless you are going for a certain type of girl that thinks of themselves as more ""high-class"", and unless you make more money than them, they are less likely to date AM. Even a short fling.

 When dating AF, I've gotten, more often than not, the remark that they don't date AM because: I look like their brother, or, ""you remind me of my dad""? xD I do not know the exact stats on whether AF marry out more, but form my experience I usually see more AmAf couples than those that marry out.",3,2021-12-21 04:33:29,aznidentity,t3_rl1upa,t3_rl1upa,hpdy4vi,"0"

I feel kinda bad for the guy, with the article title stating he's not attracted to her because she's Asian. while it does basically sorta come down to that, he seemed nice enough in this video and it doesn't seem like he was very conscious of his own subconscious racial preferences beforehand. besides, he phrased it as ""not used to"", which is actually pretty normal? and maybe if he'd hang out with more non-white people, he'd be able to overcome his prejudices and preferences?

...altho I'm also aware that this is a ""safe/inoffensive"" way to say you're kinda racist.
at least he didn't do an accent and talk about how all Asians look the same xd
prefacing it with 'I’m not racist by any means but...' is uncomfortable and pretty dumb tho

u/s0gdo2,"Yes, Sinophobia has been continuing to grow in Japan unfortunately. Again, pan-Asian spirit in Japan needs a lot of work done. I'm sure much of the Sinophobia has to do with Japan's vassal state status to the US, bc Sinophobia is actually on the rise in South Korea too, another US vassal state. The West has successfully conditioned them to believe that P.R. China is a land and money hungry power that seeks to encroach bit by bit into their lands until they fully seize their lands and fully put them under their rule. The West uses such propaganda statements such as China supposedly trying to take Senkaku Islands, and that gives their propaganda more credibility and successfully brainwash the Japanese and South Koreans even more. You got those right-wing Japanese nationalists doing their share of spewing out Sinophobia, but they've been doing that forever but it's not even out of racist hatred of Chinese people, it's out of their hatred of Communism/Socialism which is fine, but even the right-wing factions and politicians who hate the US/West too have also fallen for American/Western Sinophobic propaganda and they don't even know it, bc Japanese society is just that entrenched into their lies. Whether it's ordinary Japanese folks, or Japanese affiliated with the nationalist right-wing, they need to wake up and and start coming to their senses, that it's not rational to think that China would actually invade Japan for any reason, even the Chinese government would know that it would be a waste of money, time, and resources, they'd get nothing out of Japan, they don't even have natural resources, even Chinese nationalists would shake their head at the idea of spending all that time occupying an island with nothing to offer. The most China would ever do is put Japan under a short-lived military occupation, (perhaps a joint-military occupation with North Korea?) but that would only happen if Japan sends their self-defense forces (JSDF is basically a US mercenary force) to fight alongside the US in the war the US is constantly provoking. But even that wouldn't last long and would be reasonable to make sure Japan doesn't suck up back to the US or try to pull anything stupid once the occupation ends. China could've easily ""vassalized""/subjugated North Korea and Vietnam, but they didn't even do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Japan is one of those countries where either you are Japanese Japan and you are judged based on how you adhere to the culture otherwise you are gaijin. Doesn’t matter if you are 100% Japanese born in Japan. A lot of people that leave Japan and go back may automatically be judged if they don’t do everything that fits in. It’s like people are consistently conscious of conforming to Japanese society and what it means to be Japanese.  
&gt;  
&gt;Filipino and Nepalese are now considered the cheap labor.  
It is a very homogenous culture, and some groups simply don’t hang out with each other. Filipino and Nepalese are in their own enclave. Maybe at the university people meet other international students.

I honestly wouldn't change this, for any society to become multicultural/multiracial is harmful, think of any once-homogeneous country that decided to ""embrace diversity""... never turns out well lol. While I am a pan-Asianist, I believe that all Asian countries should maintain their homogeneity, for example; I have nothing against Vietnamese and see them as Asiatic brothers and sisters, but i wouldn't like to see overwhelming numbers of them settling in Korea or Japan bc they're still a diff people, culture, and language, even if they fully assimilated into Korean culture and language. To put it simply, I don't think pan-Asian solidarity doesn't go as far as letting each Asian country becoming a clusterfuck of diff Asian ethnicities, cultures, and languages. Ofc, I don't mind SOME diff Asians settling in Korea and Japan, as long as they're not XMs or XFs. If I moved to Japan or Korea, I wouldn't care how much of a gaijin/foreigner the average Japanese/Korean would see me, I'm not looking for their approval, I just want my place in my beautiful ancestral home countries, that's all xD. We Koreans and Japanese are literally genetic/cultural/lingual brothers and sisters (Yayoi people, hence why we bear the same haplogroups), but we still have our unique identity to an extent, that's why I'm still hoping to settle in Korea more than Japan.",2,2022-02-14 18:09:29,aznidentity,t3_sn9oqs,t1_hwvcvax,hwxoqmu,"0"

My favorite I’ve heard is “ghost man”. XD

Personally, I’ve only had Kimchi a couple of times. I am not typically a fan of fermented foods. It’s an acquired taste that is less common in the states/EU so it makes sense why we white people don’t like it. But anyone who disparages your taste is just being ignorant. As it’s been pointed out in this thread, every culture has their fair share of disgusting foods they’ll eat. For me? Insects are a no-go. But I think it’s just because bugs skeev me out. Something about the way they move? I dunno. But I will eat scrapple which is just ground up meat and organs, and that’s pretty gross.

To each their own. I wouldn’t sweat it if white people don’t like the same foods as Asians. You don’t have to like our foods either! But it’s rude to disparage one another’s choices, regardless of who is doing that. If white folks are constantly giving you guys a hard time, I’m sorry to hear that. :[

u/MasculineGoldenMan2,"this practice is ubiquitous throughout asia. In south east asian countries for example, almost every company will try to hire a white 'doctor', who is most likely just a tourist or long term PR holder/migrant, to be the 'face' of the company. asians tend to look up to products from the west, so these companies try to trick other asians into thinking the product is from the west. since there are millions of such companies in asia, this is the reason why there are millions of sexpat 'CEO's all throughout asia, and why the number of W migrants on asian countries exceeds the number of asian h1b visa holders by fourfold. every one of them is a CEO there XD

this is very sad though because the international innovation index currently shows that it is asians, not actually W people, who make the most innovative, and by extension, high quality products.

u/jz654,"If you're worried about Chinese people, thanks but honestly the social credit system isn't the problem. It's not a serious problem unless you think FICO in the US is also a huge problem. It doesn't work the way Americans think it does.

This is the original ACLU writer who talked about it:

[https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/consumer-privacy/chinas-nightmarish-citizen-scores-are-warning-americans](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/consumer-privacy/chinas-nightmarish-citizen-scores-are-warning-americans)

&gt;Update (10/8/15):I’m starting to hear questions raised (here and here) about the accuracy of the source on which I based this blog post. I did include a passing caution about my lack of direct knowledge of the source’s accuracy, but I wish I had been more explicit in offering that caution given the language and cultural barriers between the United States and China, and the scarcity of reporting on this system by professional journalists with direct knowledge of Chinese society. I hope to see such reporting soon. That said, the Chinese scoring systems still sound plenty bad, and we all still need to consider the danger that our own institutions will drift toward such systems and their potential abuses.

Check out his update.

He admits here and later that he is not fluent. He did not understand. Yet, this and other superficial ""research"" spawned years' worth of memes.

The social credit system is simply a record of people having bad credit MAINLY from not paying fines, having too much debt they're not paying, or having criminal records. It's actually far less mature/invasive than the credit scores we use in the USA like FICO. There are so many ways you are being ""scored"" in the US, often times without people knowing. E.g. you can get good student discounts on your insurance, so I hope you've been getting good grades in high school or college.

So ironically for our ACLU writer Jay Stanley, we *already have our ""own"" institutions with such systems*. They already get their share of criticism in the US, just not as often as what China has because people fear more what they are not used to and what they don't understand.

It doesn't help that when American writers pen up scary stories most of them don't live in China and don't understand enough to pinpoint the exact problems. So when they hear of stories like Xu Xiaodong (the MMA guy who got fined by courts), they pinpoint the problem as the social credit system being used to punish people extra-judicially for having wrongthink. THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE of the problem. The problem is that he \*was\* punished judicially with a fine. His *refusal to pay the fine* is what caused his social credit to drop. *Judicial*, not *extra-judicial*. The social credit system punishes bad credit as it does having criminal record (which is what bad credit score in the US punishes as well!).

So if XXD was wronged, it would be by a presumably corrupt court. Not the credit system!

Now, the weak judicial branch, relative to Chinese executive branch... weak rule of law in general IS something I agree with. That is a problem I actually see. I'm actually ok with people criticizing Chinese gov't when they know what they are talking about. The problem is there are so many uninformed people who somehow feel they are qualified to speak when they're so incredibly lazy and literally only know about it through memes. They get unearned pride by assuming all Chinese are brainwashed so if they know anything at all, like just saying the words ""*Tiananmen Square! Got you, stupid wumao. Bet you never heard of that one huh???*"" means they know more.",5,2022-06-06 07:27:01,aznidentity,t3_v5e2e9,t3_v5e2e9,ibccbn7,"0"

Never mind where K-12 is gleeful white nationalist revision (which America doesn't do, just Japan and every single Japanese school and person is revisionist just like it was really Teh Orientalz who conquered and enslaved America, college is a big part of the whitewashing of LGBT stuff. I went to elementary in Japan. I'm gonna shelve the Cultural Revolution of Mainland China because that *was* a redefinition of what it meant to be Chinese. But it's the same as the topknot/ ""MaN bUn uwu"" or how we're perceived for being us and whitesplained our own *mother tongues and literal place we grew up* by some guy who was part of a foreign government enforced colony of rapists for a couple months, where they have their own TV and radio because God forbid they have to hear a ""foreign language"" while, yanno, being foreigners. 

But no, this all was literally imposed on the world for most of the second millennium A.D. just like opium, but then *we're* the backward intolerant sex daemons. This is literally macro-scale abuse. 

OK, I derailed myself. 

Point is demonstrating what I'd been saying about the difference between liberal and conservative in particularly this country that is only ""first world"" if the metrics of determination are so badly skewed that we're all considered to have the same access to *a doctor and roof over our heads as a Carnegie* is more or less *purely semantic.*",3,2022-06-13 05:24:03,aznidentity,t3_vb42rn,t3_vb42rn,ic67l3r,"0"

And yes a lot of the time it does look suspect because the Asian girl is attractive and the White man is often a bit goofy looking, but I don't think its fair to refuse to be friends with any Asian girl who has a white boyfriend even though by respect its your choice to .  Obviously if she is the type who degrades Asian guys and glorifies White men,  then I wouldn't be friends with her because yes she is THAT type. Also  sometimes in the West there isn't a big pool to choose from as Asians are a minority so obviously people would tend to date interracial a lot of the time.(Yet ironically funny enough even though we are a minority where I live which is in South Africa the girls I've dated have only been South East and South Asian )  My cousin is dating a white guy and he is a great and pretty normal bloke.

Never mind ""Racist black rappers are ApPwEcIaTiNg YoU uwu"" 

Sidetrack: I don't remember who it was, but a comedian on the cable channel AZN, part of the quickly cancelled Asian press, had some nice sarcasm about this one racist rapper's racist song. The song has a bunch of ""ching-chong""y gibberish and then she says something about ""Pordo Riken"" and Chah-neez boys"" (""Pordo Riken"" can also be heard in Rolling Stones' ""Miss You,"" and is simply the East Coast equivalent to West Coast's calling all Latinos ""Mexi-kin,"" and this is all the same as us all being ""Chah-neez"" or ""Je-ahp"" or whichever is the most hated of the moment) and the comedian took some sarcastic potshots at it.

My take on the Akwafina disaster is that a. Saying that low-classness is innately black is the racist thing, b. Even if it was innate to them or their culture, if we're violently gaslit out of ever saying their rappers/media are/is racist to us when it's racist to us, goose, meet gander.

u/Commercial-Secret281,"&gt; The reality is that AM would date white if they could, they just can’t because of racism.


This is what AF tell themselves to feel better and assume Asian men think of white women like they think of white men. I mean some do but mostly it's basically projection or maybe just how things are from their PoV. Beside that statement being a hypothetical that has not been tested in reality, you can easily see the facts pointing to the contrary if you look hard enough. I would concede that that this is changing as more and more AM realize how things are in reality and stuff like stop listening to their hypocritical moms who hate their sons dating non-Asians cause they won't be able to control them.


&gt; The kind of hate blame and focus on asian women just is to me so blatantly misogynistic. It’s white supremacy’s fault that we are in this situation.

Calling out literally racist behavior is not misogyny. People using it as a deflection anytime women are criticized for something has destroyed all the meaning behind it. ""Uwu white supremacy made me date Richard Spencer and bodyshame Asian men on national TV"" is also not a valid excuse.

&gt;Why there isn’t more frustration directed at the white supremacist system and less obsession over Asian women who are just reacting to the same system that AM are is def kinda crazy to me.

Sane AM are mostly mad at how AF propagate anti-Asian male stereotypes and stuff to justify their white fetish and never give back to the community as a whole when they get into positions of power and continue to tow the mainstream line. And other part are AF simps who can't cope with the fact that Asian women like/are attracted to/prioritize Asian men less than Asian men are attracted to Asian women. This holds true even in Asia. Some double down on it. Like have you seen the AF simps posts here lately? Apparently AMAF relationships are cosmic and divine lmao.


&gt;the solution isn’t to reclaim some weird misogynistic type of masculinity embracing all the shittiest things about patriarchy.




The only solution for AM is to realize that most AF (even who only date Asians) will never get their PoV and stop expecting stuff from Asian women, realize they have a harder hand but can still have a fulfilling dating life with some effort and consciously try to overcome their racial preferences in dating and whatnot.


Oh and realize AM and AF are pretty much separate tribes now, western fetishization of AF has divided us almost fully. Asian women understand it, hence their hesitation in calling out balant Anti-AM racists like Esther Ku and countless others like it says in the OP.",13,2022-07-04 00:29:31,aznidentity,t3_vpzay7,t1_iep73l7,ierg0ne,"0"

u/Specific_Sun4932,"yes, 100%. and it is based on a wrong understanding of facial structure too.

Korean plastic surgeons are the most experienced surgeons in the world, and according to them, you CANNOT make a nose sharper with a nosejob. thats NOT how it works. according to them, the ONLY thing that can make a nose sharper is to RECEDE THE JAW BACKWARDS. Indeed, this is the reason why only asians who go to korean plastic surgery end up with sharper noses while those who go for plastic surgery elsewhere don't. in fact, those who get injections to make their nose bigger such as women in thailand actually end up making themselves look FLATTER.

the reason being is that the 'sharpness' of the nose comes from the angle of the midface and chin. when the midface and chin are on the same plane, the face looks 'flat'. however, when the chin recedes behind the midface like caucasians, the midface becomes 'sharp' and projects outward. thats really all there is to it. back in the day i have experience with studying korean plastic surgery methods and this was what made me realise what really makes a face 'caucasian' and what makes a face 'asian'.

in short, what makes a face caucasian is a receding jaw, which does look good on females, but looks TERRIBLE ON MALES, which is why korean men recently stopped doing receding jaw surgery as of 2015 due to noticing their face looks like shit after it and why wh\*te men wear beards to cover up their receding jaw. lu's are the only people in the world who think a receding jaw looks good, not even other asian men think it looks good XD

you can play around with plastic surgery software if you don't believe me. you will notice that you can turn every face hapa or caucasian simply by receding the jaw backwards, not even doing anything else. receding jaws, however, are unhealthy.",2,2022-10-14 02:29:45,aznidentity,t3_y3ae1d,t3_y3ae1d,is8ng77,"0"

Re

&gt;This would be a boost for the Asians to take up Chess as a career.

But I was unfortunately not rooting for Hikaru in FIDE FRC 2022 because Hikaru is against Hans Niemann even though Hikaru, Hans and Wesley are all American compatriots. I find Hikaru a traitor to both Asia and North America for siding with Hans over Magnus. I was definitely rooting for Nodirbek after Wesley was out of the group stage.

u/WorldlyViewer,"hey friend, while I relate to the tone of your message, I think it's important to 

(1) consider why a lot of us on this sub singled out the restaurant (maybe you wanna do a bit of online research on that since it'd be unfair for us to take the time to explain to you; personally I was a main poster who raised awareness of how hypocritical and white-enabling this restaurant was in October/November-ish on this sub, so you can educate yourself via an online search also of the past threads/posts on this topic here) 

(2) keep in mind that most of us have lives outside of this sub XD and this sub's ""activism"" really is online ranting + **effective use of social media in some spare/free time** (ex: less than 1% of our time lol), so don't worry this doesn't give any ""bad image"" to our sub because our sub is important to us but never takes away from much more impactful forms of activism!

(3) it doesn't matter that most of us never want to eat at this restaurant (same here, these racist establishments are never my taste anyways). We still have a responsibility to  SPEAK up when we see segregation, hate, and others of our community speaking up. We have to look at the bigger picture. The restaurant is very nasty in behavior — I personally have dealt with them and their enablers one-on-one. **I guarantee you, any amount of tanking their Yelp page and giving them an OVERALL BAD numeric rating would convey a strong message :)**",10,2022-12-18 03:12:23,aznidentity,t3_znzwkr,t1_j0nsg9f,j0o1pvv,"0"

u/livingroomsessions,"I can agree with the self-fulfilling prophecy thing. I won't say that all AM or even most AMs do this. But the characteristics you describe are definitely valid points to be taken. Like I think if a dude has political commentary about WMAF vs AMWF, I'm with you about not bringing it early into dating. I feel like that's something worth talking about once you guys get into a groove or if the topic of asian masculinity or something similar gets brought up. But yea you don't just pop open with that XD.

Complaining about friendzone for being a nice guy isn't just an AM thing, but I definitely agree that's bad too. There is however a culture clash in this particular point though because in Asian culture, just in general people are encouraged to be more graceful, polite, etc. and that by being so, it will yield ""results"". That's not necessarily the case when it comes to dating in America.

As for exuding bitterness about dating as an AM. I would request AF and XF to be a bit understanding about that especially since mainstream media has been a bit hard on AMs. It's getting better, but it's still a thing. However I do agree that if AMs feel bitter about this, showing that bitterness early into dating is not a good look.

u/lilaku,"i've picked up a lot of the basic characters growing up watching tvb with subtitles; i know that the subtitles are swc, but i can usually pick up at least a quarter of the subtitles from dialogue

when i started delving into classical studies, i used https://ctext.org/ as my main resource (there are english translations to some of the more well known texts on ctext, but i find those translations a bit lacking) alongside free online chinese history and philosophy courses on edx, as well as various lecture videos on youtube from a few different professors/teachers in english and cantonese

for understanding the characters i'm not familiar with, i use various dictionaries, but my first goto is usually wiktionary; i don't really struggle with pronunciation much because i'm basically near native in my ability to listen and speak, but i do like searching the title of the text i'm working on understanding with either 粵語 or 廣東話 to see if i can find a recording or video of someone reading the text on the web/youtube/bilibili

i think having a basic understanding of the histories and philosophies in english (and also being able to discuss most of those ideas and values in cantonese with my mom) really helped me with the process of understanding these texts; classical 文言文 chinese isn't really common for day to day dialogue XD so unless you have specific interest in learning the histories, philosophies, and culture before modernization, it might feel like chore or a huge drag

one other method for a fun way to learn chinese, especially if you love singing, would be regularly doing karaoke! i have a few older relatives, who have never had formal education, learned literacy through karaoke",2,2023-01-25 20:44:43,aznidentity,t3_10l7m5y,t1_j5v7qmp,j5vctow,"0"

Your ability to have your root culture may have been cut off because of things that were done/said/threatened to your parents. Due to prison camps, JAs often have no JP language skills, are usually, if Xer or later, mixed from some kind of pairing hostile to the Asian parent, never mind that AnTi-RaCisM Uwu is fine with still beating Japanese people for speaking our language, but sure, yts (and other races that get to be Real People ^tm) get to run around eating seaweed, speaking fake broken Japanese, wearing trad clothing complete with topknot, and nicknaming themselves gohmee-bakouh (a few may see what I did there) while also shovelling off blame for centuries of colonialism onto JP's 80-ish years that *came from the Meiji Party THEY CREATED,* so even most AsAms hate us, even here, when Asian immigrants from the places actually affected are largely unlikely to, and I sure as doughnuts do NOT see mass hate of Brits, Spanish, and French in AsAm places. And also, all the eye-rolling news hysteria in US-subjugated countries (S Korea is another one) literally comes from stuff like CNN/Fox News/Reuters. LDP supremacy in JP happened because the US literally took Japan over after WWII. But with the Lol War Games Uwu US especially plays with Asia and Asian lives, I can see ZH's reaction making sense even though it's based mostly on the same disinformation about US ""allies"" (forced subjects) that is pretty much all of what sources are available to the average EN-only speaker. 

Anyway, my main point is that basically society likely stole/coerced away roots from your family somehow, and now they're LARPing what they took from you and playing out a Dances With Wolves fantasy of being Honorary Asian Better At Asianness Than Actual Asians.

u/artrockenthusiast,"YouTuber That Japanese Man YUTA has great videos on this sort of thing as far as Japan (where I'm from) 

Sure, racist ideas came with both President Filmore's still ongoing legacy of co-opting Japan, and of course, go around the world with propagandistic US media. 

But just like the West slams Africa for supposedly inventing the homophobia that Europe and particularly a former pope somewhat recently (in my lifetime, but I'm likely one of the oldest people here as far as just age, even though I'm new to AsAm comms), same with the general West (US leads the charge here) and claiming we invented racism. 

I actually call this stuff WMB 2.0, as in White Man's Burden--a poem Rudyard Kipling wrote to justify the US colonialism of the Philippines and EuroAmerican colonialism across Asia. 

The idea was that we were all savages and it was their burden to Civilise (tm) us. By doing things like destroying our queer communities and total ways of life at rifle point (pre-CIA Japan had rich queer communities) 

These days, WMB 2.0 is about Teaching us Savages (uwuwuwu) to Tolerate 🙄 human diversity that the yts toooootally didn't destroy and force us to take on their hate no siree...

And also keep not just the general public of the West turned against especially Asians, but non-white-ruled (on face, anyway) countries, but also to keep all us oppressed squabbling so the top dog can take everything not nailed down AND continue to have exploitable class-castes of people because the EuroAmerican system doesn't wanna stop being rooted in exploitation. 

So they also inject poison into old wounds they rip back open and say ""only WE can protect you from your brothers and sisters."" 

As for my own two cents, I've been here (in the US) almost 30 years (not my choice, I'm just stuck now)

Kids pick on each other for anything, but adults, it's like, mostly in less cosmopolitan area like I grew up, ""unusual person."" Like being under five foot seven and someone six foot eight passes you on the sidewalk. 

Places like Toukyou? Shoot, there's plenty of Ethiopian and Ghanian tradesmen in Japan working in fine coffees and chocolate! 

Actually, Monsanto caused a disaster In Ethiopian farms, and it was JP farmers who went over and helped translate the manuals and help them recover. 

China and Mali are also good friends. 

Also, there was a article recently on the English web (ignored in the US mostly since they think other languages have gay commie cooties 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️) about easiest languages to learn for EN speakers. 

JP speakers went around to find out the easiest language to learn for native JP speakers, and it turned out to be Swahili! 

U of Oosaka has a foreign language self-study website, and Swahili was one of at least two non-Arabic African languages offered by them for a long time. 

Though I'll say that I personally wound up excitedly showing the JP articles to a native Swahili coworker (who both white and black staff largely treated exactly as badly as they did ALPOC including me) and while it's on the back burner while I work on much more immediately necessary languages in my life, someday I will expand upon the Swahili she taught me and I also begun picking up on my own from U of O and also a textbook they recommended and I special ordered from my local Kinokuniya.

This area has also long had a large Ethiopian and Eritrean population, and it's been a pleasure to have coworkers and colleagues and friends from there as well :)

This long comment is actually supposed to be partially comprehensive.

EDIT: Unfortunately, it's only available on a site that only works on desktop because ""CrEaTiVe ViSiOn,"" but for some serious background on how black Americans were turned into anti-Asian reinforcement, that's one small part of what led up to the Los Angeles/anti-Asian riots of 1992, and you gotta watch Grace Lee Boggs' K-Town '92.

u/lilaku,"i've tried learning mandarin in the past, but i struggle with it every time; i've decided it's easier for me to learn literacy through my native tongue despite how little resources there are because mandarin grammar just feels so unnatural to me — i much prefer the more neutral grammar of literary 文言文 chinese over the northern-influenced grammar of mandarin; plus my tongue has trouble moving in the ways northern chinese folks do because i'm too used to producing cantonese (and english) sounds; i will learn how to speak mandarin someday in the future, but i feel like i'm able to improve my listening just in the process of learning literacy — i also feel like learning mandarin or any other chinese language (閩語, 吳語, 湘語, 贛語, 等等) would be much easier after i've mastered literacy

as far as my learning method, i'm not sure how efficient it is compared to other formalized methods of learning, but because i'm a bit of a historophile (i get it from my mom) i figure i can learn literacy the same way chinese folks did before the modern era — via the classical texts mostly from ruist 儒家 and daoist 道家 traditions; i personally have a huge interest in world philosophies, so i had a basic understanding before i started my learning journey, but i really think [this video lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/@chinesethought) really helped me in my process; i use [https://ctext.org/](https://ctext.org/) as my text source (the english translations on this site is a bit lacking imo, especially if one knows and understands the chinese meanings, plus many text don't even have translations), and i try to find cantonese 粵語朗讀 readings version of the more well known texts either from youtube or other corners of the web so i can directly associate the sounds to the characters; i really like [禮記：大學](https://youtu.be/SXMpJE_WXMY) ([accompanying text](https://ctext.org/liji/da-xue)) — the great learning from the book of rites — as a beginner or starter for learning classical text and literary chinese because it's pretty good philosophy and fairly easy to understand with enough context; i also like to memorize and recite texts as if they're song lyrics and singing them like cantonese 粵劇 opera XD it's kind of silly, but it's also just fun for inexplainable reasons

i'm also practicing my brush calligraphy skills by copying the classical texts i'm focusing on (i just use scrap or regular notebook paper, don't feel the need to waste money on fancy paper for practicing since my writing looks like chicken scratch sometimes)

for referencing characters, i use a few different resources: [wiktionary.org](https://wiktionary.org) and [an android app called ""how to write chinese character"" by developer named ansami](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansami.hkchinesechar&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US) are my two main go to when i need to reference something; the latter is such an amazing app that i decided to get the paid ad-free version, but i had used the free version for over a year and didn't find the ads intrusive or annoying; i really love the app and wish there was a desktop/browser version as well, because there's be no reason for me to use [cantodict](http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/scripts/wordsearch.php) anymore XD i still use that and [words.hk](https://words.hk) as backup, but wiktionary and the ansami app are way more extensive

anyway, if you haven't noticed by now, i'm sort of a nerd and a geek when it comes to learning and reading into chinese culture and history; i really don't know how well my methods would work for someone who's not as into these sorts of things i've mentioned

as far as expanding vocabulary goes, i try to focus on being comfortable with spoken vocabular first; since my parents and i live together and we all work from home, and because we have tvb in our home, my mom will get me to watch certain programs with her as she knows i'm interested in certain topics (history, culture, architecture, construction, interior design, etc); shows like 記住鄉愁, 夢想改造家, and 無窮之路 for example; we'll talk about what we're watching and if certain words or phrases are used that i don't understand, i'll ask her to explain them to me

i dunno, i really like this folksy way of learning; it feels very personal and appropriate for me; makes me care way more about what i'm learning than just trying to brute force it through standardized text books (which, again, are very lacking when it comes to cantonese learning anyway); but i do admit i feel like i'm in a very privileged position because i still maintain such a close connection to my parents for a 竹升/abc, and because of me moving back home with my parents due to cancer with the pandemic that followed, i'd been given so much time and freedom for me to pursue my own learning without having to really worry about financial/economic pressures from the outside world; i feel like a hermit, but i'm okay with that

&gt;i dunno, i really like this folksy way of learning; it feels very personal and appropriate for me; makes me care way more about what i'm learning than just trying to brute force it through standardized text books (which, again, are very lacking when it comes to cantonese learning anyway); but i do admit i feel like i'm in a very privileged position because i still maintain such a close connection to my parents for a 竹升/abc, and because of me moving back home with my parents due to cancer with the pandemic that followed, i'd been given so much time and freedom for me to pursue my own learning without having to really worry about financial/economic pressures from the outside world; i feel like a hermit, but i'm okay with that

That is very insightful,but at the end of the day you are taking advantage of that privilege, while most squander it.  Right now I'm kinda on a similar path as you but not as far along or hardcore. I'm more interested in the history aspect, love learning how china came to be.  Do you also dabble in history? I recently got into daoism as well, albeit very superficially.  Do you have any good resources for that for an ABC? hahha, it's too bad my cantonese vocab is very limited (watching TVB news for me is a bit difficult, since they speak so formally)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;anyway sorry for the long wall of text XD i hope you could get something useful out of it

Don't apologize, this is very insightful and I would love to learn more!  This is exactly the kinda discourse i'd like to have, thanks again!",3,2023-03-24 04:30:32,aznidentity,t3_11xiifd,t1_jd85bdr,jdgau8m,"0"
u/lilaku,"as i've mentioned before, i'm a bit of a historophile, so i'm pretty obsessed with chinese history — more so with earlier chinese history than latter; my particular interests are during periods of major cultural and philosophical (including religious) developments like:

* the eastern 東周 zhou that encompasses the ""*spring and autumn""* and ""*warring states*"" period《春秋》及《戰國》時代 — this period really laid out the foundation of the chinese civilization for the eras that follow as well as the later developments of chinese culture; \[and to answer your question\] the video lecture series i linked above (linking again here: [Chinese Thought: Ancient China Meets Modern Science](https://www.youtube.com/@chinesethought)) provides an excellent and contextualized historical overview of the many thoughts and ideas that developed over this period — many of these thoughts and ideas are still alive today, even if it's sometimes on the subconscious level (mostly due to the cultural 文化大革命 revolution), and like prof. Slingerland says in the beginning of the series, the western world could benefit a great deal from understanding some of these ideas, because it's very inline and in tune with human needs according to modern science
* the northern and southern 南北朝 dynasties — its name is a bit misleading because it wasn't just two dynasties, but rather a succession of multiple dynasties split between northern and southern china (and a sub-split at different periods within the northern and southern dynasties); despite how seemingly complicated the geopolitics of this period seems, it's actually way more stable than the even more chaotic period of the sixteen 十六国 kingdoms period that preceded it; major advancements in arts, culture, technology, medcine, astronomy, mathematics, cartography, buddhism, and daoism happened during this time, which provided the groundworks for the subsequent short-lived sui 隋朝 dynasty and my most favorite period of chinese history to study and romanticize...
* the tang 唐朝 dynasty — considered by many to be the cultural golden age of chinese civilization, and the golden age of arts and literature that even the much more technologically capable song 宋朝 dynasty (a dynastic period that was also extremely appreciative of the arts, even to its own detriments) would look back to; the first half of this dynasty saw major advancements in women's liberty partly due to the royal lǐ 李 family's claim to being decedents of laozi/老子, who is credited to be the founder of daoism, a philosophy that, at its core, cherishes and embraces femininity and a more softer or yielding approach to life; i can really gush and go on forever with no real point nor direction here, but the first half of this dynasty saw major cultural and religious exchange throughout the entire asian continent from western (and southern) asia all the way to japan due to how developed the silk road and sea routes were

i really recommend sticking through and watching all of the videos on prof Slingerland's channel in the order presented by the playlists on the channel; the second half of the lecture series covers zhuangzi/莊子 which is a very influential canon of daoism

i've started to realize that must of my own personal views and beliefs actually stem from classical daoist thoughts, but in a very informal and folk tradition way, passed down by the attitude towards life exhibited by my mom (many of the traits i've internalized in myself without any instructions); the more i learn about daoism from more formal texts and lectures, the more i feel like i'm coloring in the lines that had always been within me, if that makes any sense

as far as watching cantonese news goes, i totally get what you mean XD though ever since i started watching it daily with my parents after moving in following my leukemia diagnosis, i just got acclimated and become familiar with it over time; it really expanded my vocabulary just by exposure — the subtitles, while not a word-for-word transcription, also helps in my understanding

i'm also actually trying to do the same for developing my mandarin listening skills by watching various period/costume c-dramas (so far, i've watched *the longest day in chang'an*《長安十二時辰-》, *the rise of phoenixes*《天盛長歌》, and i'm current in the middle of louyang《風起洛陽》); i'm watching them with english subtitles, but i'm also quite surprised that my brain is actually starting to automatically pick up and translate certain phrases and sentences into cantonese now without me making effort to do so XD it's great

i've also been watching a few of the c-dramas in cantonese with chinese subtitles via [https://tvbanywherena.com/](https://tvbanywherena.com/) (shows like: *my heroic husband*《赘婿》, *the imperial coroner*《機智女法醫 / 御賜小仵作》, and *royal feast*《尚食》— the latter two are cut shorter in the cantonese dub) and i plan to re-watch them in mandarin with english subtitles

there are certain troupes and clichés that bug me about c-dramas, especially when they try really hard to milk dramatic and emotional moments, and especially their use of slow motion without high-speed cameras (maybe because i'm too used to western cinematography), but i do generally like certain aspect of the screenwriting of c-dramas in historical settings that really exemplify many of china's unique cultural elements and moral teachings

anyway, all this really helps me feel connected to my cultural heritage; i feel so much more confident in my identity than i had ever before i started my self guided learning journey; so much so that i'm extremely proud to be chinese; it makes me sad that western society can't understand because their culture (based in consumer capitalism) really does seem extremely shallow compared to how deep chinese culture truly is

i also haven't even mentioned my meditative qigong 氣功 (hei3gung1) practices that have really been helping me with a lot of my aches, pains, and energy level since chemo, and me being more mindful of traditional chinese medicine concepts in my daily diet (we also rely on a lot of chinese herbal medicine in our household), amongst other very culturally chinese practices like our gardening/farming methods that my parents have always kept with; i've finally found my roots, and thanks to that, i truly feel grounded and in tune with the world around me despite how bleak and uncertain the our economy and geopolitics have become",1,2023-03-24 23:16:51,aznidentity,t3_11xiifd,t1_jdgau8m,jdk19cd,"0"

I don't know the details of their home life beyond what's here, but abusers will financially, as well as physically and mentally, exploit you and then make you feel like *you're* the one who can't function and will fail without *them.* My dad died of abusive white woman, and I fell into the same sort of trap he was in with my ex-wife for many years. Just, other factors kept my ex-wife from completely isolating me (and the existence of the internet is actually one of them. I left her in Facebook's heyday, for a reference) so it's very easy to extrapolate here.

u/Special-Possession44,"""and the Asian moms were always running around doing everything for their kids and husband.""

asian women act completely different around their low tier 'trophy' white husbands compared to how they act around their asian husbands. in places like china and asian america, asian moms in general don't give af about their kids, like if you go to a park, 9 times out of 10 its the asian guy playing with the kids or watching the kids while the mum is sitting on the bench playing with her phone or not even present. or go to a chinese restaurant and 99% of the time its the father doing the cooking, washing the dishes, mopping the floor etc. while asian mummy sits at the cash counter waatching tv drama or playing her phone. heck, china is the only country in the world where the majority of divorcees go into MALE CUSTODY rather than female custody (aka most chinese women abandon their children to their ex husbands, nasty shit) unlike in the rest of the world where female custody is the majority.

however, suddenly when an asian woman is married to a white man, suddenly she acts completely different and does a 180 and literally plays pretend to become the dream 'submissive trad girl' that white men want, its all theatrics. heck, even the girls mother comes out of the woodwork and starts taking care of the wmaf kids too. I was at the park and saw this white worshipping old ass asian mother in law so proud of her wmaf kids that she was watching the kids HERSELF from 9 am until 3 pm even though she was old and low energy and i just had to laugh because i had never seen this happen even once back in asia XD

I could Google, but I wouldn't know fair vs slander/propaganda. 

As for your statement, that is a HUGE problem; absolutely agreed. I genuinely also think this ageism-as-woque bit is at least partially responsible for the whole neolib rise of ""consequences for misdeeds is bad"" (see: San Francisco) 

Now the root of that actually came from way back in the '80s, turning minorities (racial, gender, religious, etc) on each other to stop Civil Rights movement. And all I mentioned above slowly became implemented or propagandised. 

Those birds came home to roost here: 

https://nextshark.com/george-floyd-asian-american-businesses

Today, the ruling class-caste is very fond of granting new business owner grants to right-wing members of Golden Child non-Asian minorities to send them to perpetuate gentrification of those same Asian neighbourhoods who may still have some places boarded up and now have many places empty because of the violence (we are the Scapegoat, of course) as well as refusals to make small business aid more accessible to our communities specifically vs other communities. 

The current stuff you may know of under Boudin in SF and why it is as it is now rose really suspiciously soon after the incident in the above link and non-Asians in NorCal only began getting upset in significant numbers about it rather than cheering it on when a boutique/high-end mall (as they're now generally high-end rather than how malls were when I came here as a teen in the early '90s) in Walnut Creek, a mostly white town, suffered this same fate. 

So there's also that. 

But yes, this ""punishment for doing bad things/wanton crime is the problem,"" which came with the whole Boomer 2.0 resurgence of ""you wake up on your 25th birthday morally evil uwu I'm so not bigoted (how dare those Japs be ageist about marriage age unlike me who is not ageist at all!!!1!)

you are one of those CIA glowies warned about in the asianmasculinity sub,  that constantly make such dumb posts on asian subs to convince asians that america is superior and that there is no racism or bamboo ceiling in amerikkka. a word of advice to you, if you want to be more convincing, don't exxagerate XD",1,2023-09-28 10:41:27,aznidentity,t3_16oa8v5,t1_k2ja6p4,k2k4qu0,"0"
u/Special-Possession44,"don't change the goalposts, you stated that it is quite easy for asians to make 100k in amerikkka, why are you now qualifying your statement and saying ""not all asians, just asians born and bred in amerikkka?""

Why are you so defensive of Panda Express XD?

u/artrockenthusiast,"Yeah, this person clearly (as seen in especially the last paragraph) is pulling the typical abusive thing of push all the buttons until the target snaps and then maintain that the target is unreasonable. 

Particularly since society at large considers us so much not ""Real People uwu"" that they act like listening to us is equal to eating manure, it's probably easiest for the racist to do it by picking on Asians. 

You hafta be careful around his type, but I'd privately find out where everyone else stands, and go LC or NC with this sack of filth. 

I know their partner is or was your friend, but valuable lesson from someone formerly in social work (a field extremely hostile to ALPOC thanks to both fash and neolib Dumbler and Twit(ter) rhetoric as well as being a magnet for tinpot dictator types, which Western radical individualism fosters to begin with) :

You can't help everyone, especially someone who won't be helped. 

Keep this in mind as you find out where everyone stands and try to re-sort your circle.

the american easstasian diaspora is lost and defeated. in 200 years they have not been able to produce a single CEO of a white corporation (except for companies they built for themselves like doordash and yahoo) in contrast to the indians, who are accepted because of their caucasian features. the only chinese CEO's are found OUTSIDE america how funny is that?
