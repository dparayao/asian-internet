u/jedifreac,"http://reappropriate.co/ usually has good food for thought.

I would also just google around, there's stuff in Asian American studies journals that talk about this in length.   There's stuff in this summary (including in the references section) 
http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/faculty/henryyu/APACHP/teacher/research/sueyoshi.htm

This one is older but still has some interesting insights: 
http://books.google.com/books?id=6mzOaVZn6acC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;lpg=PR8&amp;dq=The+Woman+Warrior+vs.+the+Chinaman+%5Bsic%5D+Pacific:+Must+a+Chinese+American+Critic+Choose+Between+Feminism+and+Heroism?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ciEBy5oWk_&amp;sig=a1UMjAIjuLgqT5maKgSK_nWqniE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4TqUICGJKK3iwK51YDABg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Woman%20warrior&amp;f=false

I'd also just google for general stuff about emasculation and how it is oppressive to both men and women in different ways.

The tl;dr is that emasculization is really rooted in misogyny.  Culturally the idea of being not-masculine (in this case, feminine?) is really threatening to men (probably even more threatening to men of color who already are treated poorly for their race.)    But what it's really saying is, ""(for a man) to be like a woman is to be inferior"" with the added implication that women are inferior.   It's not good to be ""somebody's bitch"" or a ""pussy"" or to be ""such a girl"" or to have a ""tiny dick"" because that is emasculating.   So there's this idea in some subsets of our community that Asian American men need to prove their prowess, that they are masculine, etc.  Is there a way to do that without reinforcing the gender binary and driving a wedge between cis men in the APA community and everyone else? 

(This shit affects Asian American women too, because we are emasculated/feminized to the point where we are objectified and seen as sexually available because objects can't say no.)

It is not okay that ""feminization"" has been used as a tool to label and subjugate Asian American communities.  It is not cool when someone labels you based on an oppressive stereotype that you feel and know not to be true.  Society doesn't play fair and treats femme as bad, yes.  

On the other hand, how we react might be able to reduce it's power.   There's a difference between saying ""No no, I am masculine, let me prove to you how much I am like you by doing things you do, let me show you how I am like you"" and saying, ""Go to hell, you don't know me; your labels are messed up and very transparent, I can see what you're trying to do.""   

Ok ok real tl;dr is that anti-feminist approaches to racism end up helping both the patriarchy and white supremacy, which doesn't actually really benefit anyone other than white dudes, so it is helpful to read up on feminism to avoid implementing anti feminist approaches to fighting racism.",2,2013-01-07 08:11:18,asianamerican,t3_1621a8,t1_c7sh7zg,c7sih10,"0"

u/svsm,"I'm from Sydney. It's good and bad:

Pros:

1) If you live in the CBD of any major city, especially Sydney and Melbourne: There are **a lot** of Asians. It's boosted by the fact international students tend to congregate in the city, and you'll probably find more Asians in Sydney's city centre waking around than white people (many of whom are also international students or tourists). 

2) We don't have affirmative action. Asians make up pretty much *the whole population* of most selective high schools. They are pretty much the majority in many uni courses as well (as international students are big business for Unis here). There's definitely prejudice for some courses that require interviews and 'holistic' admissions, but it's nowhere as ubiquitous as it sounds like in the US. 

3) The food is good. God, the food is good. 20+ years ago we used to be a cultural backwater when it came to cuisine, but with our close distance to the whole of Asia, and immigration over the years, you can find pretty much anything in Sydney. You want Indian? Burmese? Hunan cuisine? Shanghai? Nepalese? Korean? Thai? North Vietnamese? South Vietnamese? Anything you want, you'll find in specifics. *And it will be good*. Sydney has many ethnic enclaves and within each you can find a specific country's market stocked with the ingredients you need. 

4) Our proximity and reliance on Asia, specifically China to drive our economy means our politics are fairly different to the US. Both sides of politics are astonishingly racist and anti-immigration, but our economy rests on China. It holds back a lot of anti-Asian rhetoric from both sides of politics. Recently examples include our handling of our Country's FTA with China, and our response to the US sending a patrol ship to the South China Sea (condemnation, but no action. Australian-Chinese joint naval training to still go ahead.) 

5) Asians make up a larger percentage of citizens than in the US. We may not be as numerically big, or influential as American Asians, but you'll find the dynamics of having a larger proportional population refreshing. 


CONS:

1) There's no PC here. White Australians can pretty much trash Muslims, Aboriginals, Asians (including Australian born Asians) in public, and unless your YouTube video goes viral, there's pretty much no consequence. You'll have to learn to fight, stand up, or yell back. Do so. If you don't, they'll learn it's safe to target someone else. 
Of course the no PC rule doesn't apply to *you*. There's a reason minority (even mentally ill minority) 'racist YouTube rants' don't seem to exist. Even the mentally ill know being a minority does not grant you reciprocally racist privileges. 

2) ""*This is Straya. If you don't love it, leave.*"" ""*Fuck off, we're full*"" You'll hear this a lot. 
As an Australian born Asian, that always particularly annoyed me. But as an American, I don't know if you can actually adequately reply to that lol. 

3) [Yes, these are real shirts.](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7ok6HzYiSLFCXRjICrlU_4c4z-WzetT9CCiHllABg2Ka9UW2S) No, they're not ironic. Yes actual people wore them on Australia day, and anti-foreign ownership rallies. No, there were no consequences. 

4) No, you still can't be a main character in a movie. A non-fetishised female lead. Or an Asian male with a love interest [Mychonny excepted.](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/3prfdz/sucker_official_trailer_starring_mychonny/) 


OP, if you've never come to Australia, I really recommend it overall for a short to medium length visit at least.  There's pros and cons to the country, but the Asian culture and it's proximity to Asia may be a really good experience. It might even evolve your own perception as an AA (Asian American to Asian Australian). Feel free to hit me up for any recommendations if you ever go to Sydney.

u/SomeEpicName,"Aww, that's horrible!

I've heard of the sex trade stuff mainly from Koreans and Scandinavians, countries where it's a huge trend for rural and/or creepy loser men to find desperate wives in SE Asia. Fortunately, the typical ""girlfriend"" is much darker and more SE Asian-looking than me so they don't seem to associate me with that as an individual. 

After I realized that SE Asians have such a negative reputation in southern California (where we have the ""ABG"" stereotype which seems to apply A LOT to Viet/Khmer girls in particular) I have stopped telling people what ethnicity I am and just reply ""it's a long story"", only telling the truth after they've gotten to know me well (which can take anywhere from a few hours to several months).",1,2017-07-19 05:49:31,asianamerican,t3_6nh6zv,t1_dk9ri4j,dkezzqi,"0"

u/IAmNeeeeewwwww,"My two cents as an Asian-American guy, and I think this applies to anyone in his or her 20s:

-**Just be true to yourself and be yourself.** As cliché as it sounds, that's the first thing anyone in his or her 20s should remember. While this point (along with some of the others) doesn't look like it's directly affecting ""looks,"" trust me, it is: You won't believe how much attitude and mindset really reflects on your outer appearance. But anyhow, if you know that the ""center-of-attention"" party girl isn't you, then don't force yourself to be. On the flip side, if you know that a shy, reserved ""good girl"" isn't who you are, then don't force yourself to be. The same goes for guys in the reverse. Bottom line: Don't fake it because nothing is more unattractive (and cringey) than a pretender.

-**This probably goes in line with previous point, but be true to your intentions and expectations, and be natural about it.** Know what you want and be clear and honest about it. You want something more than a friendship? Then don't hang around doing the most while calling yourself a friend. Now, that doesn't mean be an asshole; just don't be a pushover or an unnecessary volunteer. And whatever you do, don't act like a robot and state your intentions and expectations up front. Let it show. Everyone gets the hang of it eventually.

-**Whatever you do, live and learn.** Disappointment and rejection is a natural part of life. I'm 27 and I'm still learning after countless failed relationships and a failed engagement. You'll get in the hang of it. Will you feel some bitterness and resentment for the ones who have figured it out when you've failed? Sure, but we're only human. But don't go off on rants about how Mr. Six-Pack with the nice car and a six-figure salary is a fake who can't see ""nice girls"" for who they are (And I can assure you that the opposite is true for the guys). If you want to go after the fake guys, get double-eyelid surgery and fake DDs, and deck yourself out in brand-name clothing and accessories (for real though, don't... I'm being sarcastic) because fake goes for fake, and frankly, fake deserves fake. But to save yourself trouble, read the first point.

-**As shallow as this might sound, try to look healthy and dress to impress.** This might sound contrary to everything I've said, but understand that I'm not telling you to work yourself into a bikini body or dress up like an ABG (Asian Baby Girl). Just try to look healthy and live accordingly. When you get some exercise and eat right, you'll be thinking a lot more clearly and you make better choices, not to mention, you make it a lot easier to keep yourself focused on the points I previously mentioned. Now I understand that certain body types and genetics make it difficult to have a flatter stomach, a thinner waist, or the *""S-Line""* (Korean slang for the waist-hip-butt-thigh curve). But remember to try to live and look healthy and dress to your body type. Search the Internet for which kinds of clothes accentuate which body types. And while you're at it, it wouldn't hurt to go to a hair or beauty salon either. The people there will know which kind of hair style will look best for you and they'll even know what kind of makeup will look best for you as well. After all, it's what they're paid to do in the first place, so take their advice if you're unfamiliar with that territory. It may cost you some, but know that your appearance is something you have to be willing to invest time and money in. I told this to all my guy friends who looked like the stereotypical ""Asian Nerd."" But when they got it, everything began to turn around for them in the dating department. 

-**Most importantly, learn to appreciate the non-material joys of this world.** As a Korean-American whose parents are immigrants, I grew up solidly middle-class: Not so well-off that I got everything I wanted, but not so poor that money was always a constant issue. As a result, material objects were never exactly on my mind all the time. I think it was probably the same amongst most women I've dated since high school... of course there were a few who slipped below the rader, and their materialistic demeanors are the reason I'm not with them right now. Show that you want to be with someone for the non-material things they could offer, whether it's an unconventional date like wake-boarding or an awesome indie rock show, or something as simple as an interesting conversation at a locally owned coffee shop. Interesting begets and attracts interesting, and being interesting is attractive.

**TL;DR:** Being attractive is more mental and psychological than it is physical, but don't ignore the physical either. Most of all, try hard, but also remember to not try hard... if that makes any sense. It will take some time and a lot of effort, but know that once the mental and psychological elements are down, everything else will fall into place.",2,2017-08-08 05:17:09,asianamerican,t3_6s0ogx,t3_6s0ogx,dlbgpey,"0"
u/IAmNeeeeewwwww,"It's quite easy tell if you've lived on both sides of the Pacific like myself. But also mind, that Asian-American isn't so much a ""look"" as much as it is an ""attitude.""

-Clothing. I'm not the most knowledgeable on it, ditch whatever you might have worn overseas, but don't try too hard to dress ""American."" Sometimes, this is how I pick out foreign-born Asians. Wearing too much Abercrombie, Hollister, or Victoria's Secret PINK, sticks out. Also, at least with what I've noticed with Korean girls, skirt length and skirt tightness. Even considering certain body types, a lot of American girls don't wear skin-tight miniskirts after high school on a usual day, even with stockings and leggings underneath.

-As for makeup, the difference is as clear as night and day. Asian-American girls don't use skin whitener, and they definitely go heavier on the eyes and lipstick. And with hair color, avoid the red-brown or orange-brown shades. If anything, keep it as close to your natural color as you can. If you want to look artsy, I guess streaks? Fuck, I don't know, I play in a pop-punk/post-hardcore band and I dyed my hair all sorts of weird fucking colors.

-Now for communication. The accent and intonation is correctible. Easy? No. But with enough time invested, you can sound more ""American."" Learn the ""American vowels"" as opposed to the ""neutral vowels"" of international standard English. Abandon whatever intonation of your primary language. This is how I know who acquired English in an English-only upbringing vs. a mixed-language upbringing. As for the nonverbal aspect of communication, it's a tough one. This requires you to deprogram every social and cultural cue you've unconsciously absorbed at home. But there are some quick fixes. Try speaking and listening with your palms and the insides of your forearms facing upward. You'll look more open in a conversation. Always maintain eye contact, but look away periodically to avoid looking creepy and/or insincere. If holding eye contact is tough, look at their nose. And if you can, use your hands when you speak; while it may be stereotypically European, with a corrected accent and intonation, it'll help you look more ""American"" in the sense that you look less ""Asian.""

Most importantly, be who you want to be and don't worry about looking ""more American."" If simply looking ""more American"" is a concern, you can always go full-on ABG (""Asian Baby Girl""). But seriously, don't do that.

And don't try too hard either. I knew a Korean International student in my dorm and it was just excruciating to watch her try too hard to ""fit in.""",5,2017-09-05 21:01:49,asianamerican,t3_6y3ae1,t3_6y3ae1,dmlxt9n,"0"
u/rcl2,"&gt; Asian food is starting to trend in the US and other parts the Western world. Not your local Chinese takeout or Panda Express, but I'm talking things like Thai fusion, banh mi, trendy Korean cuisine, etc., are becoming acceptable and even ""hip food"" choices. Why go to a plain-jane, boring vanilla diner when you can go to a more colorful, exotic and trendy Asian place? They used to laugh at our food choices, now it's all over their IG pages.

Most of the Asian cuisine that is ""trending"" now wouldn't have been acceptable even 10 years ago; it's only cool now because some white person made it acceptable. White people used to make fun of our food and us for eating it; I'm supposed to forget that?

&gt; Second, media. Let's not talk about Gangnam style. Let's take a look at something like the Far East Movement...everyone here knows of their local Asian party scene with the ABGs and Azn bros. FEM just packaged it up and sold their lifestyle right back at them. Ghost in the Shell, Iron Fist, Blade Runner 2049, etc...the fact that these movies have featured Asian themed visuals, locations and aesthetics shows that they like Asian arts and culture even if they don't want to represent ""us"" while they're at it.

Yeah, while replacing all the Asian characters with white ones, to again, make it more acceptable. Asian culture is cool as long as there's no Asians in it, nothing beyond having them there as window dressing or moving scenery.

&gt; We're also getting more prominent in sports and not just sports that ""we"" invented. We've got people like Jeremy Lin that show that you don't have to be an abnormally tall dude from Nowhere, China to be a star. We've got a ton of Instagram fitness pages run by people like Bart Kwan who do good in ""their"" sports and can show you just how much they're just like everyone else while they're at it. We've got people like Younghoe Koo that were actually born in Asia, are very obviously Asian but are becoming rising stars in American sports with barely any Asian representation.

Random token Asians in American sports isn't some kind of tidal wave of change; it didn't happen with Yao Ming, it won't happen with Jeremy Lin either.

&gt; Finally, in Asia, we've got expat and white foreigner populations that seem to grow every year. They may not accept or like the local culture, they may not even speak the local language, but the fact that they choose to stay behind and swallow it shows that they prefer their current life to the one they had back in their first world English speaking countries. That says a lot about Asia today.

I've lived in Japan and Korea. 95% of those expats are losers back home, and usually have some kind of Asian fetish. The only thing they're good for is ""teaching"" English AKA English daycare. They have no desire to speak the local language because they think they're too good for it. They choose to stay because they have no other options; that says more about them than about Asia.",2,2017-10-10 19:31:33,asianamerican,t3_75edl6,t3_75edl6,do6mnb4,"0"

u/[deleted],"Most of the Asian guys I know (ABCs) have a preference for Asian girls, so I'm not sure why you're having trouble matching with them when you're able to match with decent-looking guys on Tinder. Not saying you're doing anything ""wrong,"" of course - just unsure of what the issue may be.

&gt;I've been told that I don't look very Asian and fit the standard of beauty so I'm starting to feel like that's really hurting me with online dating.

Did they give you any details here? You can often tell how ""Asian"" someone is by their clothing, makeup, and accessories. ABGs present themselves differently from sorority ABCs, nerdy FOBs present themselves differently from nerdy ABCs. The stereotypes associated with these different styles are not always accurate but Asians will make snap judgments about other Asians based on them anyway. If I see an Asian girl dressed like an ABG I'll assume she's mainly interested in Asian gangsters or crazy rich Asians. If I see a sorority ABC I'll assume she's mainly interested in white or Asian jocks. Maybe the Asian guys on Tantan want someone who presents themselves as ""more Asian""?

About meeting people in real life...do you have any circles of friends where a significant proportion of them are Asian? A bunch of my ABC friends met their ABC partners through friends of friends. Like while hanging out, or doing activities.

I see people use it as tongue in cheek.

IDK, I'm like pretty young compared to some of the posters on here who work or have families, and I feel that it was pretty common for people around my age (high school Asians, college asians, asians in their 20s) to use it in a joking way but it does describe like an aesthetic of Asian girls I see in like areas that are Asian enclaves or just decent population of Asians. 

Like I've seen people use ABGs to describe rave asian girls or sorority asian girls or just asian girls with dyed hair (used to be ombre, now its like highlights) whose friends are usually other girls with same hair, usually wears specific makeup type look, does e-cigs, drinks easily, often eats out, and usually dates/hangs out with male asian bros.

There is a mainstream culture within the Asian community that is adopted as an identity and a badge of honor. That’s why nextshark has 14 articles a week titled “you know you’re asian when”, “how you can tell if you’re an ABG”? And when you don’t subscribe to that narrative they start calling you names. 

And then the twinkies get butt hurt and start name calling the mainlanders rude ass fobs.

This was 50% of my high school existence growing up in Brooklyn. Both sides are insecure with their identities so they lash out at the other side for not being proud or authentic. While proudly proclaiming that their experience is the /true/ Asian experience.

u/treskro,"I think you’re misunderstanding OP, and perhaps they didn’t make it as clear as it could be. 

My interpretation of this is not necessarily that OP is suggesting that we latch onto nebulous concepts of ‘Asian culture’ directly imported from the Old World, but rather formulating an Asian American/western diaspora consciousness and culture that isn’t just uncritically derivative of the dominant culture of whatever country we’re in. 

Nascent aspects of a sort of ‘Asian *American* culture’ we might identify as existing separately from a solely negatively-defined paradigm of reactiveness to racism (not to downplay it - it’s still important) are things like boba culture, ABG culture, yes even Subtle Asian Traits. Maybe they’re just frivolous things that are by no means universal to all As-Ams, and whether they’re desirable as culture is of course up to the individual. But I think it’s something worth thinking about. Otherwise, if the only things tying Asian Americans together are census categories and being subjected to specific types of racism, is that enough to develop community consciousness? Put another way, if Asian American culture (specifically Asian American and not Asian Asian) provides nothing positive, what's the incentive for people to want to participate in that identity?",7,2019-02-02 03:55:32,asianamerican,t3_am9mvb,t1_efkf0bz,efkkawz,"0"

I'm...not even sure what that means. I've never seen a Linkedin profile that shouted ""HEY I LOVE EDM"" or ""I'M AN ABG!"". 

Frankly, what I do during my own personal time isn't of any concern to my employer, especially if it isn't breaking any laws or something that could make the company look bad. Clubbing and drinking pics? Oh no! An adult of legal drinking age out having fun in a bodycon dress. Half naked pics...do you mean like modeling pics or festival pics? Those aren't viewable to the public anyways and are on a private IG. Besides, have you been to any music festivals? It's quite common. 

I don't know man, I just don't think companies are concerned about how their employees are spending their own time. And if they did that would likely cause a big PR/HR problem they don't want on their hands. The kinds of IG accounts you're talking about are college girls and women who are either models or in an entertainment industry and are essentially using it as advertising and growing a brand/business.

EDIT: I just saw some post history and it looks like you're basing this off one person. I looked at her Linkedin and there is nothing there that looks unprofessional. I don't know her personally but she actually has quite an impressive history so if she were in my field and was up for consideration for a position, I wouldn't even care what else I found on her personal lifestyle. And I think you have the wrong idea of what an ABG is and why this would even be some sort of professional hindrance.

u/Mycele,"I had the exact same problem in college. I joined both the ‘ABC’ club and the international Chinese students club. After 2 years I accepted that I don’t fit in any neat box and I never will. 

I’m too Chinese and too in touch with my culture for the ABCs, who deep down are still wrestling with a hate for their own skin color. They felt exactly like what they called themselves, bananas. I had no interest in bonding over anime, ABG culture, or just boba tea. I grew up with an understanding of the richness of my culture and I didn’t feel their insecurities on the same level.

Even worse I felt most of them were only friends because they were asian looking. That felt cheap. 

The international Chinese never felt like I was Chinese enough. I am fluent and can read maybe 500 characters, but that’s less than elementary school. I couldn’t keep up with the trendy slang, puns, and games. I also didn’t go through gao kao, the high stress country wide tests that determine your entire future. So I couldn’t really relate and was too American. 

You don’t seem to fit in either box and that can feel lonely. I’ve always wondered if there could be a different name for people in this category.

I disagree with the posts saying you should teach the ABCs. This is exhausting to be the ambassador for an entire body of culture thousands of years old. 

I did it and it wasn’t rewarding in the way you might think. 

These days a lot of my friends are Singaporean or international expats from Japan or Taiwan. They are bilingual or trilingual. The crux of the problem is about culture. 

What you need to look for are groups of friends who bring the richness of their own culture with them. Look for friends who are more like salads than a mixing pot. Individual cultures distinct but together with harmony.

For me there were two choices: 

1) Embrace ABC culture where my heritage is diluted and learned only through the lens of Westerners. Such as just watching Mulan, drinking boba, or listening to the occasional Chinese song
2) Travel through asia, research my own traditions, go to museums, pick up a hobby my culture commonly embraces,etc.

u/jonaf,"If I can make some generalizations, I think the podcast's sweet spot might not be for people ""here"" in this subreddit.  The [yappie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOntet85kBw) backgrounds of the hosts is probably most relatable to millennials of similar backgrounds, and some Gen Z on a similar trajectory or with similar aspirations.  The Asian-American racial consciousness of this specific demographic isn't that strong yet, but it is budding/emerging -- and so the podcast is appealing with the AA-tinged perspectives and insights on career, life, health, etc, especially in the famine of AAPI-specific podcasts otherwise.

In contrast, I think that there is some overlap between that audience, and those that are on reddit, period, and some might lurk this subreddit specifically.  But, I think and picture many that spend time on this (/r/asianamerican) subreddit, and especially those who engage in comments and conversations here, already hold a very deliberate and well-developed AAPI perspective on the world.  The kind of analysis and nuance in the other comments ITT illustrate that pretty well.

All that being said, I'm a cis-male, don't have a corporate job, and I've listened to many of the episodes... and I think ABG episodes are awesome.  They are both an anthropological-ish peek at another dimension of AAPI's who are the same generation as me, and the frankness of many conversations around topics like relationships and sex, fears and failures, and (not perfect) family relationships have been refreshing. While the criticism about being East-Asian-centric is accurate (which is a phase and challenge that Wong Fu also is tackling, which I recall Phil articulating specifically in the past), it's commendable that the hosts (Janet, Helen, and Mel) seem to also be aware and proactive around this.  

Each of us can only do our best to constantly be aware of our specific positionality and perspectives, and ABG has modeled incredibly the transparency, vulnerability, empathy, self-reflection, and collective care that otherwise is often unexplored or unspoken-of territory for AAPI's that don't have access to the (rare) deliberate support circles that cultivate this.",5,2020-11-03 09:05:40,asianamerican,t3_jmzc44,t3_jmzc44,gazm3t8,"0"

Japanese cyberpunk references is akin to 70s/80s at the peak of the Japanese boom, which is when western Boomers were in their peak years.

Until I see boba shops or ABGs in cyberpunk movies or games I'd say they definitely stuck  in the past.

It's also a sign of how Western popular cultural references is slowly becoming oblivious and irrelevant to the rise and takeover of Eastern pop culture (Korea's Hallyu is just one slice of it).

For the record I am Asian American but majority of caucasians in the country (specially those who haven't travelled outside of the Western hemisphere) have no idea of the seismic cultural shift that's happening. This is also one reason why anti Asian/Asian American sentiment is on the rise, as most Western caucasians for at least two or three generations have been so accustomed to being the center of the world (not just pop culture). That is changing fast as we move to a multipolar world, where there is no single superpower but several
 spheres of influence in the global community (North America, Europe, Asia, etc).

u/bahgad,"As others have said, visiting Taiwan is probably the best way to connect. However, they're pretty strict about COVID, so it'll probably be a while before you're able to get into the country. In the meantime, if you're able to (resource and time-wise), maybe you can do a domestic to a city that also happens to have a significant number of Taiwanese restaurants. Here are also some English language resources you could try checking out as well:

* [Apps for learning Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxUJiCz9Ycs): Self-explanatory, but these are some resources you can use to learn Chinese. Keep in mind that people in Taiwan use Traditional Chinese vs. Simplified Chinese in China, and that there are some differences in accent (think British English vs. American English) and vernacular between people in Taiwan and China.
* [YouTube Series on Learning Taiwanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbAyaip78s4&amp;list=PLTSKFutIq9d0RrnS-PD_1znABgH2EJSce): ""Taiwanese (language)"" is also known as Taiwanese Hokkien, and is one of the most commonly spoken dialects in Taiwan.
* [Taiwan Bar YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHTV_Xdrkp8&amp;list=PLwItru4bLdHwtl3sB6n3I_sIMk77_n1Ce): Videos that talk about Taiwanese history (turn on Closed Captioning for English subtitles, although they do also have videos in English).
* [Frozen Garlic](https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/): Blog about elections in Taiwan.
* [Focus Taiwan](https://focustaiwan.tw/): There aren't really good ""neutral"" English language Taiwanese news websites, but this may be one of the closest you can get.
* [Detention](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555220/Detention/): Horror video game that gives some perspective on what the White Terror period in Taiwan was like (if you don't want to purchase the game, you can check out gameplay on YouTube)
* [Devotion](https://shop.redcandlegames.com/games/devotion): Horror video game with 1980's Taiwan vibes (if you don't want to purchase the game, you can check out gameplay on YouTube)

u/PineapplePen_Pie,"Saw a couple posts on RED this week regarding Chinese girls sh\*\*\*ng on their ABC ex or potential ABC dates, and I am just curious as to has any ABCs dated international girls who are like as entitled as some of the ones below? 

Post 1: The girl is an international student who graduated from Duke, her ex (from 2 years ago) was a relatively affluent ABC from Texas who went to the same program, she claimed that he was discriminating against her because he brought a white varsity player to a tennis match with his hs school friends instead of her, when she questioned his decision to bring a friend instead of her, he stated that he felt that his close female friend would fit in better with his hs friends who were visiting. 

The ABC male would also say things like to introduce her to his mom but his mom has high standards for his significant other. 

The ABC male was also apparently a big partner goer, and had many white friends, her conclusion to the aforementioned was that he was in denial of his culture and ethnic identities, and he'd try to fit in with white people group because he was in denial, and that he needed to spend sometime growing up and come to accept his identity as an Asian male. 

Some pointed out that he might just not have liked her as much, and she claimed that people didn't know ABCs, and didn't know how the group is, and didn't know as many ABCs as she did. (She's only lived in the states for 2 years), thought she's also a huge party goer, she dresses pretty explicitly and her style is pretty much that of a Asian baby girl with heavy make up and arched brows. (Anyhow, this is girl #1)

Girl #2: She looks down on ABCs whose parents immigrate through like non-academic methods, and she found couple dates (one is ABK and one is ABC), and she was sh\*\*\*\* on how the ABC didn't speak Chinese and how he would say things like culture differences. Throughout the whole thing she's been labeling people through stereotypes-stereotyping PhDs as liking whiskeys and road trip, and steretyping ABcs as wanting to be whited-washed (bc he pointed out that they'll have cultural differences)

I am really puzzled by how many entitled international Chinese girls there are nowadays, there are bound to be cultural differences when both grew up in different countries, even when people are from the same country, there are cultural differences between the north and the south. In the past, many of my ABCs friends have willingly provided their international GF/BF the faster track to citizenship/Greencard, and obviously, there are also poachers who are after those who have citizenship, so be mindful of who you are dating I guess.",3,2022-02-21 19:15:44,asianamerican,t3_stvbu2,t3_stvbu2,hxv89g9,"0"

u/foxcnnmsnbc,"&gt;I know this can be a controversial take, but I find that Asian women are more integrated in American society than Asian men. 

I was discussing this with u/BedfordSunset on another Asian sub.  Generally, Asian American guys, especially in enclaves in California, stay in their bubble.  Whereas Asian women appear to leave the bubble more.  Or even Asian American women who are entrenched in that bubble (such as ABGS), will still much more likely venture out to Sunset Boulevard or Hollywood to party in different places.

I think it's generally the same for hiking and other outdoor interests too.  They're a bit more likely to try outdoorsy activities, at least at the recreational level.  There appears to be plenty of Asian and Asian American pros in outdoor or extreme sports.

It’s not biological. It’s not genetic. As an Asian American you’re taught that your wants, feelings and needs come second to “others” by everyone. People in the Asian community make excuses for white supremacist and patriarchal beliefs all the time without knowing it. That’s how insidious this is.

u/mekongdelta999,"&gt; While the term is widespread within the Asian American community, knowledge of its origin is not. The term actually originates from a different ABG: Asian Baby Gangster. During the 1990’s, a rise in Asian American gang activity inspired a youth subculture of rebellion, which conceived the Asian Baby Gangster archetype for women living the true thug life. The term has since been diluted into Asian Baby Girl, which caught its mass adoption in a Facebook group called “subtle asian traits.” While ABG has evolved over the years, its original goal still remains the same: to subvert the model minority myth. 

This is correct and even those girls involved in that life did not refer to themselves as ABG, you really didn't see this term until the late 90's with people having more access to the internet and then when Asian Avenue popped up and Aol instant messenger.",5,2022-11-30 16:23:27,asianamerican,t3_z3cw91,t3_z3cw91,iydhulw,"0"

I've dated from the ranges of ABGs to girls who say they ""grew up traditionally"". ABGs were definitely too different, but even those girls who said they ""grew up traditionally"" and knew their native tongue was a stretch. Big thing was, communication and how they see being grown up traditionally. 

Communication - I'm not native level speaker, but can get across decently well. Even then, there were just things I couldn't get or she couldn't understand. And worse more, when they try to speak Japanese, it's... weird. It's either textbook or learned from an elder person. Textbook, it feels like you're talking to a robot since it just lacks emotions. From an elder person, it makes you want to laugh or even be confused because there's a gap between modern and old japanese. 

""grown up traditional"" - this one I generally laugh at. There definitely is a strong culture that we grew up with, but I wouldn't make it out to be ""traditional"". Anyways, when I meet these types, it's either done overboard or just done odd.. and it gets annoying. Overboard - I had a girl who literally thought wearing a yukata everyday inside was a must, or get on me for pointing shoes inward when I was over was another must.

u/Separate-Squirrel-32,"Stereotypes are an over generalization and extrapolation of a specific trait onto an entire population. This means the trait usually exists at least in part. But it’s wrong to generalize from small numbers. 

I’m from an Asian country and there are all kinds of people — we are definitely fully multidimensional human beings. In America though, the immigrant population is self selected so you see concentrations of “nerds” at say a computer science midterm. That’s because you’re not sampling from the broader population

Sheng Wang made a joke once about if a white guy opened a can of tuna to eat at an airport in Wisconsin, he’s just weird. But if an Asian guy does it, he just created a whole new stereotype for his people. “They’re all like that”.

(Dumb example, I have had a few Filipina friends who identify more as Pacific Islander but have the ABG label “thrust on them” by strangers.)

Big labels are always a little weird.

 But I hung out with them anyways because I wanted to belong with people who look like me (after being the only asian most of my childhood) and we do share the same culture/traditions at home

I think those asian kids are called ABGs. Its an entire subculture and those kids are all derivatives of each other",1,2023-06-08 18:26:35,asianamerican,t3_144fwz6,t3_144fwz6,jnfef94,"1"
u/Away-Kaleidoscope380,"yea have my own group now with bjj and gym but in college that was my entire circle so definitely got a biased view.  Growing up without asians, I feel like I forced myself to have similar interests and faked it for awhile to make friends or talk to girls.  Thought I wanted an “abg” and went thru that whole phase.  Did make friends that I thought were close friends until I realized that without the partying or typical asian interest, we’d definitely not be friends.  Ngl It was fun at the time but just kind of grew out of it and started to cringe at the whole “abg/abb”.  Thank god for covid because it was during lockdown when I found my old interests again and started pursuing those rather than faking",6,2023-06-08 18:46:32,asianamerican,t3_144fwz6,t1_jnff60m,jnfhm16,"0"
u/progfrog113,"I grew up in an Asian enclave before moving away to a place with way fewer Asian people than I've ever been used to. It's been exhausting to explain everything to every new person I meet. But at the same time, I was also having to explain a lot of stuff back home too. A lot of Asian Americans don't speak their parents' or grandparents' language and are more removed from the culture. I have to translate for my younger siblings because they stopped speaking the language somewhere along the way, even though our parents don't really speak English all that well. I gravitated towards friends who had more stereotypical Asian interests because I was trying to find a place where I fit in. I didn't have to explain to those friends about my food choices, why I wasn't allowed to drink ice water, or why you can't stick chopsticks into rice a certain way. With my non-Asian friends, I had to convince them that boba wasn't gross, or that kimchi didn't smell bad, or that I wasn't eating worms but fried noodles. I have a lot of interests/hobbies that don't attract many Asian people so I have regular interactions with non-Asian people, and every time I interact with a new person I have to gauge how Asian I can be around them. Some people are fine with eating sushi, but tendon and tripe in pho grosses them out, while other people will say shit like ""tapioca pearls in your drink is nasty"". I really don't blame people for not wanting to be around that and having to limit themselves. 

That being said, just because EDM, the ABG aesthetic, raves, boba, etc. are pop Asian culture in Californian enclaves doesn't mean that every single Asian person who grew up there likes those things. Those things just happen to be popular so the majority of people like them.",14,2023-06-08 21:36:22,asianamerican,t3_144fwz6,t3_144fwz6,jng8vcq,"0"

u/visualcharm,"This is what I meant; thank you. 

When I said West Coast feels more Americanized, I mean in terms of roots. Yes, they have their own culture (ABG, etc.) but it's a unique immigrant identity born of their American experience over time compared to the East Coast where Asians seem to be less rooted and rely on their Asian cultures. Like I noticed West Coast Asians typically don't speak their ethnic language fluently v. East Coast Asians.

I think it has expanded past the gang affiliations, and has become a more mainstream slang term that is defined more by aesthetic than attitude and social circles.

u/_zeejet_,"The simple answer is yes, but it's poorly developed and fairly fluid without many clear or defining distinctions or anchors compared to Asian-root culture. It's actually quite hard to think of uniquely Asian-American traditions or practices - off top I can only think of certain aesthetic trends (ABGs and fuccbois), b-boying/dance, and raving. 

Everything else is borrowed or equally practiced by Asians in Asia (food culture at large, hairstyles, Asian pop music, etc.

We largely adopt dominant culture (white and black culture) depending on where we're from in the US and sprinkle in some trends from Asia. As a Chinese-American, I find the traditional Chinese culture of parents (tiger parenting notwithstanding) a lot more interesting and richer than what is going on in Asian-America.",15,2023-11-28 21:49:54,asianamerican,t3_1864sd9,t3_1864sd9,kb6bt0t,"0"

1. You’re more connected to your heritage than them, and that makes them insecure (maybe they felt ostracized by family for being too American, etc.)

u/octopushug,"ABC here in a large city with a significant Asian American population. I attended public magnet schools K-12 that ranked high nationwide with accelerated academic programs. Yes, even there, there were drugs and alcohol, firearms (two idiotic friends were expelled for bringing a gun to school), and sex. Did most of us participate in these activities? Yes or no, depended on the kid and upbringing honestly. A lot of us were really focused on academics, especially including a subset of stereotypical competitive Asian kids obsessed with entering elite universities. There was also the group of Asian Baby Girls and BBoys, as well as the kids who grew up around Chinatown gangs. I think home life and friend groups have a larger influence on whether or not a kid buys into certain behaviors. Most of us turned out just fine. Extreme focus on academics alone while being sheltered in a bubble can also be detrimental to childhood development. There were plenty of Asian kids in university who mentally broke under the pressure when they realized that just because they were high performers in high school didn’t mean shit in college when that was a baseline for admission. Some of them went wild at the taste of freedom when finally exposed to alcohol and other substances. I guess my point is that education system is what you make of it.",1,2023-12-20 01:48:25,asianamerican,t3_18m27gg,t3_18m27gg,ke4f2bp,"0"
