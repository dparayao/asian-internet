u/keakealani,"Well, of course I can only give my personal experience, but... here goes.

I mentioned in my comment to /u/beethovens_seventh that realistically, it's not like Hawaii doesn't have problems... and it's not even that Hawaii doesn't have racial problems. But, the racial problems are more diverse, and many of the issues people have are related to other issues. 

In particular, Hawaii has a really strong sense of ""local privilege"" (not sure if that's the legit term, but that's what I call it). Rather than judging you on your racial makeup, people tend to judge you on what generation your family came to Hawaii - and if it was the last couple of generations, you'll be at a disadvantage. It's very subtle, but it does exist. For example, there's a term in Hawaii that is pretty pejorative, ""katonk"", that refers to Asians who are born and raised on the mainland - it's similar to the ""banana"" and ""twinkie"" type references mainland AA communities have, but it's specific to being a mainland Asian as opposed to a Hawaii Asian. FOB, of course, is the other side, and there are a number of biases there, too - especially if you have an accent. That I don't think is necessarily different than the mainland, but since Asians wield some of the pointier sticks socially, it feels like a different dynamic. 

There are other dynamics, as well. There's some pretty strong currents of classism, and they cut both ways - depending on the community, there is a rabid sense of moving up in life, but there is also a strong sense of never ""getting too good"" or ""acting too white"". There is a big difference in mentality between people who go to public and private schools - I think this is different than the mainland in that a pretty substantial number of people go to private schools, even from not terribly wealthy families. And of course, it's worth taking into consideration that the cost of living in Hawaii is *extremely* high - so realistically, you're probably either middle class or homeless, because there's not a lot of in between (actually, there are a number of relatively middle class people I know that have experienced some sort of temporary homelessness, so... yeah.) 

The culture is definitely impacted. It's a mixing pot - Asians are a big part of the community, but there are several different dominant Asian cultures, and several non-Asian cultures. One way to look at the type of cultural mixing is the cuisine - it's not uncommon, regardless of your personal racial background, to eat Portuguese malasadas for breakfast, a local plate lunch for lunch, and pick up food from a local Thai restaurant for dinner. The culture in Hawaii is much more racially blended as a result of the shared plantation heritage of a lot of the Asians and Portuguese. It's also worth pointing out that really, it's not that Asians are a majority so much as that almost everyone in Hawaii is mixed, and many of those mixes include some Asian heritage. The thing about that, though, is that most people are pretty racially ambiguous - it's not worth your time to try to figure out ""what"" someone is, so people do get straight to the ""who"" that person is, which is generally less racist. 

Day to day experiences, I guess... they're maybe affected in that I don't exactly spend my time worrying if people are racially judging me. I feel ""normal"" there. People don't look at you weird if you throw some random Japanese phrase into your normal conversation, or if your lunch actually consists of Pocky and a bento. The culture is a lot more ""everyone's racist"" (a la Avenue Q) and in some ways, it does even out the playing field - everyone's fair game, so nobody really comes out ahead or behind. 

One other note worth pointing out is that Hawaii is also (I hope this is obvious) something of a tourist destination. There is a love-hate relationship with tourism, and since a good amount of the tourism comes from Asia, there's a love-hate relationship with Asians perceived as tourists/not local, which can sometimes spread to newer residents, as well. The flip side, of course, is that they often laugh all the way to the bank, since being bilingual is incredibly sought after, and a good portion of Hawaii's Asians are so many generations removed that they don't speak a lick of the ""mother tongue"" (myself included). 

For my time on the mainland, I've been living in Austin, TX for about a year now with my husband who is attending grad school. This is the first time in my adult life that I've lived on the mainland (I was actually born in a suburb outside of Seattle, but my family moved home as soon as a baby was in the picture). I don't really spend a ton of time out and about, but the culture is *vastly* different here. I can't say if it's a racial thing or just a regional cultural difference, but the one takeaway is that people are significantly more rude and aggressive than I'd ever experienced back home. People seem to have a much stronger sense of personal entitlement and individual tendencies to get ahead, which is pretty much polar opposite of Hawaii. I've heard Hawaii's culture described as ""rugged group-ism"" - and I think that's a really apt phrase. Hawaii is all about the group. If you fit into the group, everyone in Hawaii will defend it to the death. Any time Hawaii claims its favored son or daughter, there is very little culturally you can do to stop that force. But, the flip side is, if Hawaii decides you're an outsider, it could easily take you a lifetime just to get the time of day. 

I think there are a lot of differences that are completely not related to race. We were joking around when I was last visiting, as my brother-in-law-in-law is from California, that Hawaii people have a very different sense of space than the mainland. Because it's a bunch of tiny islands, going more than five miles away from home is considered a roadtrip, and people wouldn't dream of doing it on a regular basis. And, in fact, it's perfectly conceivable to spend your entire life within a 3-5 mile radius and pretty much never leave - I know a lot of people who pretty much do just that, and other than my brief excursion to the mainland, I think it's pretty likely for myself as well. There's also a much smaller personal space boundary, akin to big cities in China. An adoption from the Polynesian roots is that people will give you a hug and a kiss when you first meet, and you can expect that in small, cramped elevators, people will still move to fit someone else in, even if it means smelling what they just had for lunch. You have to have a high tolerance for people being literally on top of you, when you live on an island. 

Flip side, though, is that people are obligated to be more friendly, and like I mentioned, more group-oriented. Because of the limitations on resources, there's a strong emphasis on sharing. This is also derived from traditional Hawaiian culture, which didn't have much of a concept of individual ownership; all resources are considered communal, which means that yeah, if your mango tree is ripe, you can expect other people to ""help"" take some of those mangoes off your hands if you didn't harvest them yourself. It also means that you can probably bum a quarter off of someone when you didn't have exact change for your bus fare, but you might find yourself handing that quarter back to someone else the next day. Aloha Spirit isn't a myth, despite what some people might say about Hawaii - but again, the problem is convincing enough people that you're part of the group that shares the Aloha Spirit.

Sorry this got super long-winded... it's a little cathartic since I really miss home xD Please feel free to message me any time if you have more questions, and also please do stop by /r/Hawaii to get more opinions if you're serious about considering moving there. If I want to be realistic, Hawaii might be the mecca for local Hawaii Asians, but it's not the mecca for anyone from the mainland, necessarily. But, I guess maybe in some ways it's better to be judged by that then just the color of your skin? I don't really know.",14,2013-06-30 15:00:28,asianamerican,t3_1hc0fm,t1_casyrq9,cat6e9p,"0"
u/keakealani,"Heh, no problem. I hope it was suitably informative :)

One thing I'd be inclined to point out right here, is a big giveaway that you're a mainlander and not familiar with Hawaii's culture is your use of the word ""Hawaiian"" to, I assume, refer generally to people who live in Hawaii. That's a pretty substantial no-no because in Hawaii, ""Hawaiian"" pretty much exclusively refers to things that relate to native Hawaiian people or culture - it's borderline offensive for a non-Hawaiian person to refer to themselves as Hawaiian, in the same way it would be if a white person living in China for a couple years called himself Chinese. I obviously know you don't have a malicious intent, but if you go around doing that in Hawaii... you don't make friends. XD 

To get to the crux of your question - that's one of many dynamics that is present when it comes to newer transplants. A lot of newer communities (at least on my island, Oahu) are geared toward pretty high income areas, and there is definitely no small degree of resentment that people are moving in with a lot more money than the humble roots of many older immigrants. There's also a literal cultural resentment - there are a lot of people coming in who are really ignorant of actual Hawaiian culture (often thinking that touristy, kitschy stuff is ""authentic"") and to local Hawaii culture, and therefore have a pretty nasty cultural clash. People in Hawaii are somewhat traditionally-minded - it's interesting that Hawaii is often characterized in national media as being extremely liberal (it's really more like, extremely Democrat) because actually, the culture is extremely conservative in its dislike of change and valuation of traditional values. This is something that definitely comes directly from the Asian influence - Confucian concepts of filial piety run extremely deep, for example. 

A friend of mine likes to point out that interestingly, many of the Asians in Hawaii actually have a more traditionally Asian outlook than even their counterparts in actual Asia, because they emigrated before various Asian countries (China, Japan, Korea, etc.) Westernized; Japanese in Hawaii have a distinctly more Meiji era type of outlook than most Japanese nationals do - this is also true of many Asian immigrants to the mainland whose families were still present in Asia after WWII or thereabouts. 

There are other issues with the classism, though. Part of it is the strong labor roots in Hawaii's Asian population (which I think is different than the relatively mixed backgrounds of mainland Asians, some of which were unskilled labor but many coming from semiskilled or skilled backgrounds as well). This means that even for people who after several generations really have ""bootstraps""'d themselves out of poverty, most people still strongly value working class ideals like frugality, humility, hard work, and respect for elders. People who come to Hawaii that aren't seen as ""working their way up"" are resented almost irrespective of their actual relative wealth - a lower middle class family that is new to Hawaii might be looked down on by the upper class family that originated from labor roots in the 1850s, even though they clearly surpass the newer transplants in income. 

I agree definitely that there is a much stronger understanding that multiracial is a ""thing"" - in fact, it's almost weird to only have one heritage. I would definitely say that you're gonna see a lot more people that look like you in Hawaii than nearly anywhere else. 

The traveling thing... it really depends. You probably have a little bit of a selection bias, in that it takes a certain kind of person to want to move all the way to the East Coast for school, and those don't represent the whole group. And the fact of the matter is, there's a definite class selection there, because most Hawaii people frankly can't afford to move to the mainland for school. Our plane tickets home for our wedding cost nearly $1000 a piece, which is something most students can't afford, except for the very wealthy. 

But, it's true that island life is a different mentality. A lot of it is a practicality thing rather than just psyche. Each island in Hawaii is made of one or more volcanic mountains - other than the Big Island, I'm not sure there's any stretch of 5-10 miles that won't eventually head you up a mountain or into the ocean that you could run or bike, unless you were just doing the same circle over and over again. (Okay, I'll give a caveat here - I'm from town side of Oahu, and I know West Siders would probably resent that comment - it is more possible out on the West Side but it's a lot less developed and arguably more dangerous, plus you have a pretty high chance of hitting a military base). ((Side note - I forgot to mention the military presence, but that's another factor in Hawaii's mainland-hate.))

Island fever is a thing, though. Before we moved out here to Texas, I had it pretty bad, thinking about getting off the rock and experiencing the ""real world"" - it disappeared in like a week, but it's not exactly uncommon for people who were born and raised in Hawaii to move away permanently because they can't handle the isolation. I'd say a good portion of people, though, just don't really mind living in the exact same place all their lives - like I said, there's a strong valuing of tradition, and nothing could be more traditional than raising your kids in the exact same house you grew up in. 

Anyway. I definitely want to mention that this isn't the only experience out there - I know there are people who would probably disagree with me on at least one point. I'd definitely encourage you to consider digging through /r/Hawaii (this topic has been discussed before, I think) or starting a thread there about it, because that would probably bring in a lot more different perspectives.",9,2013-06-30 19:28:26,asianamerican,t3_1hc0fm,t1_cat9bzq,catb2y6,"0"
u/keakealani,"AMG. We just made homemade mac 'n' cheese and you cannot imagine my dismay at realizing that we never bothered to restock our spam supply (and in my partial defense, spam is bloody expensive here!). Teriyaki spam and mac 'n' cheese definitely qualifies as a comfort food for me, too. 

The real comfort food is butter-hauyau rice with fried eggs over easy on top. That shit was my breakfast like every other morning, and I know it has enough MSG to kill a village, but daaaaang was it delicious.

Jook and mugicha are my flavors of sickness, though - I definitely feel like I couldn't have a cold without a huge bowl of jook (with hauyau again - my family loves the stuff) and a big thermos of mugicha by my bed. Your congee story reminded me of that :)

IT IS A GENERAL PREGGO THING! I am already turning into a resentful Asian mother.

I think it is mostly scare tactics because 0.000001% of women will miscarry or otherwise hurt their babies from, like, feta cheese. Still, you still get all paranoid. The general rules are:

1. No high mercury fish = most sushi

2. No raw food that can be contaminated with bacteria = rare meats and undercooked hamburger etc, raw/runny eggs, uncooked sprouts (including mungbean/kongnamul) and spinach.  So fucking hell, I can't even get a runny egg on my bibimbap.

3. Nothing with high nitrates = hot dogs, deli meats

4. Avoid high levels of caffeine = coffee, teas, including my darling royal milk tea

5. No unpasteurized, soft dairy = feta, brie cheese etc. And no soft serve ice cream.

Personally, I love almost everything in that video! Huge fan of chicken feet and balut. Haven't tried or seen durian yet.

The only thing I don't like is natto. I had it once and I wouldn't try it again. It tastes fine but the texture was so sticky that I couldn't get the image of boogers out of my head.

They did a good way of presenting it and showing the Asians as any other Americans. I mean it's not like all Americans will also enjoy weird American foods like tongue toast. I also love biscuits and gravy but when I introduced it to a South African friend, he was horrified. What kind of society would eat seasoned lard mixed with flour and sausage bits for breakfast?

**Edit:** As per request from the mods. The reason why the Asian men were overlooked is pretty simple. They were men. And they were Asian. Their own community turned their backs on them. No one cares about men and no one cares about Asians men who aren't bringing you General Tao chicken. Simple as that. This is not me trying to play victim - we all know that doesn't work with men anyways. I'm stating an opinion which I believe to be fact based on my own personal experiences. 

&gt;If, as we've been over this many times before, you care for no one but yourself, then maybe reconsider participating.

I care about things that will benefit me. This is something that will benefit me. It also happens to overlap with other men in this community.

It was animated at the Slightly Offbeat Productions Studios in Penrose, Auckland, New Zealand. The New Zealand based Animation Studio originally animated the show reel and then went onto produce the series, which premiered in September 2000 on the [Kids' WB!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids%27_WB!) [block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_programming) and ran for four seasons, with a total of 52 half-hour episodes.

&gt;The series centers around the adventures of [DC Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics) [superhero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero) [Virgil Ovid Hawkins/Static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics\)) and is based on the original [Milestone Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone_Media) *Static* comics. After the show's initial run on [The WB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network) it was later picked up for rebroadcast by [Cartoon Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network), airing initially during the Miguzi block. [Disney XD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_XD) aired reruns of the series (starting with seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4) in February 2009 in the United States up until 2010. Currently, [Warner Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.) has no plans to release the series on DVD. In 2011, the first season was made available for download on [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes).

What does Thanksgiving mean to you all as AAs? I first learned of Thanksgiving when I was in Kindergarten; right after we moved to America. I thought it was cool because of all the decorations we made in class. It was probably the only day of the year we didn't eat rice. Even though I wouldn't gain citizenship for another 14 years later, learning to celebrate it with family definitely was part of my American experience. (It doesn't directly compete with our Filipino identities though; come the next birthday party, back to pansit and lumpia.)

My dad also refuses to go back to the Philippines despite my mom's wishes for short vacations back there. He has also refused dual citizenship (my mom used to but wants it back).

My mom's side's grandma is kinda a Grade A conflict avoider and avoids negativity in every possible way. My mom's side's grandpa isn't really helping since he's very toxic as a person lately (blatantly racist and offensive as a person... sorry grandpa), and his family doesn't help with being... interestingly almost stereotypically poor. My mom had to cut a couple of her previously close cousins on my grandpa's side because they've been trying to leech off of the US relatives.

Everytime something comes up with corrupt cases in the Philippines (post-Yolanda failed relief efforts, Enrile case, Bong Bong Marcos running for presidency, finding out my niece's situation regarding a certain big ""charity"" organization), my dad goes into a huge lecture about how Marcos and his web have ruined the Philippines, stole billions from the people, and how the people there aren't really helping the situation since they're obviously avoiding it.

Also I really think the Marcos era is a direct correlation to the economic status of Filams. From the most recent census, Filams are the #3 subgroup with the highest average household income. Meanwhile, in the Philippines over 40% of the population is below the poverty line. I really think the shenanigans of Marcos and the current politicians (I'm looking at you Enrile, Romualdez family, Estrada, Bong Bong, Binays, and the rest of your posse(s)) have probably made the ""talents"" of the Philippines move elsewhere.",3,2015-10-11 04:53:48,asianamerican,t3_3o968f,t3_3o968f,cvvjgo2,"0"
u/brianna_rune_,"I think that this is a problem that a lot of black women face (not me, but that is because I've never dated and my bad looks have nothing to do with my race XD ). Our features are considered unattractive (despite the high usage of tanning beds, curly haired perms, lip/butt/booby injections and etc, that has become very popular around the world, especially in White communities), and we are stereotyped as ""aggressive"" , slutty and ""too strong"". Most of the times that I have seen black women mentioned in a ""positive"" light online, it was usually :

A) A fetishest who has this weird obsession with black women and thinks of us as ""big butts and lips with attitude"".

Or

B) Black men who have believe that we are like this, but are still attracted to black women (because only being half-self hating is fine, right?)

And the very few times that I saw us mentioned in a way that was actually charming, it was from black guys who didn't fall into any types of self-hatred. While I do think that this is a serious problem, I also believe that it is very important for black women to focus on reducing the issues of self-hatred in our community and racist beliefs about us first. Because a lot of the distaste for black women comes from racist ideologies, and we should focus on preventing people from becoming racist, because once someone becomes a full on racist, they are too tainted and you really shouldn't try and date them.",0,2015-10-20 03:02:11,asianamerican,t3_3p7t0b,t3_3p7t0b,cw5z5ja,"0"

Iono where the logic came from. Or maybe he thought since Koreans have hanzi-versions of their names that maybe if he/she typed something up in Chinese they could still understand? I mean the logic kind of applies to Japanese people, if I type up something in traditional script they could maybe understand like 10~20%.",6,2016-06-23 22:59:23,asianamerican,t3_4pimkc,t1_d4lg8w9,d4lgvbk,"0"

u/Siantlark,"A lot of them also get flirty with Asians. 

Akong_Supernoob pointed out that Katana's Japanese husband lives in her sword. Kamala Khan gets flirty with Kamran, a significant portion of Mettle and Hazmat's storyline in Avengers Academy was them falling into a relationship. 

The thread is about Asian superheroes. My focus was on Asian superheroes; of which Batman, Iron Fist, and Wolverine are very clearly not. 

His point was that Asian girls are seen as only partners for White men. False. His other point is that Asian men, when they exist, are sexless or emasculated. False. 

Amadeus Cho is hardly a muscle man dripping with testosterone but he's not a chaste Buddhist monk. He often flirts with people while in his Hulk form and is a normal teenage boy around girls when he's not. The Asian Atom was apparently a chick magnet even when he didn't really want to be. Jimmy Woo is a suave secret agent man who's only love interest is Asian (And his grandniece which is somewhat ew). 

And of course, Most Excellent Superbat is Most Excellent Superbat and has to be mentioned because he's Most Excellent Superbat. Seriously he's great. He'd show up in the MCU, but that'd probably destroy the multiverse. DC is trying to prevent the incoming Moneypocalypse by never ever showing the Super Young Team ever again but that's cool.

u/fail_bananabread,"tbh the ""white perspective"" is really something that has both detriment and merit.

I think from the perspective of a young chinese person, the disney version is actually kind of refreshing, that's why it's actually rated pretty high on 小清新 site like douban xD


I mean tbh, mulan doesn't really go to war because ""the country needs her"", more because the men of the household are too old and too young, thus face certain death. She has a younger brother, so I mean, from the perspective of a chinese woman, 容我内心阴暗一下 when you put it in the chinese social context. Esp considering the fact that when disney's mulan came out, in the 90s~00s era where a LOT of rural girls gave up schooling to support their brothers through school. (I mean vice versa also exists but it's not as prevalent and often the sister in question is a total 学霸... as in first in her class, the bar is set higher) I'm sure those girls were fulfilling their sense of filial duty.",3,2016-11-22 07:48:33,asianamerican,t3_5e18jq,t1_daakwos,daaqe6z,"0"
u/fail_bananabread,"&gt; On top of that, I think deep down Chinese feel upset because we didn’t do it. Mulan is our legend, and we didn’t do anything about it that’s nearly as cool and beautiful. It’s like you have this hidden treasure somewhere, and you’re too lazy to use it, while someone else steals it and makes good use of it. A lot of people asked, after watching Mulan, why can’t we do stuff like this? We have so many legends, stories, and what do we have for animation and cartoon?

This is pretty much the prevalent attitude that I see as well. And tbh I do agree that white people and chinese americans probably will always have a western perspective when doing a chinese story, because they simply lack the complete cultural context compared to a Chinese person raised in China (and they shouldn't be expected to be the same, because chinese americans are **american**). 

The problem is I think China/mainland still has a way to go when it comes to building cultural confidence plus the technical know-how and actual creative agency + respect + good wages paid to screenwriters.

* 1920s: Asian immigration is banned
* 1940s: Oh jeez we can't block our war allies from immigrating here. That looks super bad. Hey look, China, it's all cool. You guys can come here.
* 1950s: Now that we've fixed Japan up to be democratic and capitalistic, you guys can immigrate here too. We're friends. See?
* 1950s-1960s: Our American children are becoming delinquents! Also all those damn Chinese Commies keep sneaking into our country. (Chinatown leaders: lets show them how well behaved our children are with our traditional family values! Our children can't get into trouble after school since they go to Chinese school after school! Let's ignore the illegal communist immigrants).
* Also 1950s: Look at the Japanese. They got stuck in internment camps and they just moved on and now they're fine. Hey, now I have an excuse to give black people for not treating them like human beings! Why can't you be more like these upstanding Asian Americans, black people? They didn't make a fuss! (Asian people did make a fuss. They were just ignored until it was convenient not to ignore them).

Still really bad at single leg balancing stuff and got a little lost (same instructor but a lot less guidance) through some of the poses I'd never done before, though.

Even I dont like talking to random people and I am a guy, really it is bad all around but it is probably worse for you.

Multiplayer games such as MMOs have a somewhat more balanced group of players of all different backgrounds. If you wanted something in the shooter genre I unfortunately have no real good suggestions as I do not play those often and cannot speak for a community's friendliness.

Some single player games I liked were deus ex human revolution, the witcher series, and tales of symphonia/berseria. I would need to go home to go look through my game library to suggest more XD.

If you like the diablo series and particular the action rpg elements and hardcore elements of games I would suggest Path of Exile which is free to play and a really complicated but high quality game. If youve played final fantasy X then the leveling system is similar and the skills function by putting skill gems into slots in gear and putting support gems into slots connected to the skill gem. Really complicated but you can get some great satisfaction from the system. There is no real voice chat and the community is friendly all around so it is definitely worth a look imo. Their subreddit also has a lot of players helping players and a lot of funny shitposts with memes. If you play always select the temporary league in softcore which right now is breach. Never pick hardcore unless you like playing the game and not being allowed to die, did that recently and didnt even make it to endgame. The lore is also great if you like dark themed stories.

One of my biggest suggestions for PC gaming right now though besides path of exile is Sleeping Dogs. An excellent open world single player game.",1,2017-01-26 00:17:44,asianamerican,t3_5q1hf8,t1_dcwpzds,dcwtjn6,"0"

I know they dont mean anything by it but it just rubse the wrong way. Also it reinforces the fact that although I can speak jpn well enough to get by barely...a lot more will be expected out of me if I need to get places XD.

u/akong_supern00b,"Personally, I had a blast.  My minimal Japanese was enough to get us where we needed to go and to speak very basically with some locals.  Sometimes, though, it felt like they thought I was mentally challenged when trying to cobble together some barely functional Japanese or asking some very basic things, lol, like when I wanted to know what karaage was or didn't know there was a different word for rain umbrella vs parasol.  They always tried to speak English to my friend.  It was way more pronounced outside of Tokyo though, where people would straight up ask him for pictures or sneak a pic with their phones.

Akihabara was fun.  I think we were both on our way out of anime fandom though, so we just kinda passed through a lot of the anime stores without really doing much shopping except for video games.  Spent a *lot* of time and money at the arcades.

I wanted to go to a maid cafe for a laugh, but my friend outright refused to go because he thought it would be embarrassing, lol.  Another friend went to one a couple years before and said it was as awkward as expected, but hilarious in its own way.  Said it got super weird and voyeurisitic after a while though. The women and cutesy stuff is one thing, but the kinds of people who frequent such establishments are a whole other kettle of fish.  Some of them are kinda odd, as you'd expect. XD

I definitely miss the food.  Even the konbini food.  Can't just go down to 7-11 here and get some onigiri or bento boxes.  While we were there, we had katsudon almost every day, but very few Japanese places around here seem to have it.  The best katsudon was actually in Sapporo and nothing I've had or made here compares to that.

u/Senario-,"I got mostly the same ching chong stuff all my school years. Yadda yadda yeah I know I have a 4 letter last name and it is easy to make fun of it. Especially with the words dick, balls (or lack thereof apparently), and good ol ""chink"".

In middle school they universally used gay as an insult and used it towards me plus racial insults. At the time I could only vehemently deny it bc it simply wasnt true but now I know they were kinda homophobic in additon to racist bc they incorporated my background into it. 

In high school they incorporated desexualization plenty of times. I guess it has made me somewhat sensitive to these issues bc even in college I took anti asian bias a bit tough. PE was hell bc I was still overweight and I would always get yelled at with racial slurs or insults. It never really stopped and I felt really bad daily. I had hoped it would end and things would be different at the next school i attended but I said the same in middle school to high school to college...

Wish I could say it didnt affect me but I am a romantic at heart and the teasing only exacerbated the problem. Through all my school years I desperately(like bad desperate) wanted go to out with somebody and just have a good romantic life. I am not sure how much of it was wanting to prove the insults wrong (the usual asian stereotype ones.) And how much of it was me just liking romantic stuff in general, often reading romance manga bc anime and manga was my only outlet and still kinda is, but it was pretty destructive.

I would admittedly awkwardly (read creepily) be interested in a few ppl throughout my school years. It was destructive bc I am fairly sure I caused problems for the people I was interested in. Ironically the one person who may have been actually interested in me I ignored in highschool bc she was white (realized this in college, dont remember her name) and I wanted somebody who shared a similar experience to me as a filipino american(somebody who was also filipino I thought was a safe bet). Ultimately this came back to bite me in the ass later in my high school years bc I shared that opinion with a diff girl who i eventually became interested in...but she was Japanese american not Filipino. The stories I could tell though of me being just a straight up bad guy XD. I wish i could say sorry to all the people but I know that I acted poorly and awkwardly.

College being the time that really ruined a lot of my hopes and the idea of romance for myself. People apparently will backstab you not once but twice in quick succession with two different groups of friends. Then you'll be treated as a pariah for the rest of your school years bc two extremely mean bullies who think they are all that want you to go away. This time they were Korean american. I dont know whats wrong with me and why I have faced more problems from other minorities than whites but it is disappointing.

Still not successful in that regard today but if I am being honest I dont really deserve much of anything much less actual romance. My career hasnt exactly panned out like I thought it would, I am extremely awkward and honestly dont make for a good conversation buddy often having heated debates about serious topics, still pretty geeky and even though geekyness is on the rise there still are more men than women(all of whom are taken), and I am fairly sure I am an asshole after all this time and becoming jaded lol. I still love romance stuff but I am in a weird spot where I cant see it happening for me and more or less enjoy other people's stories XD. For example I am going to watch ""Your Name"" by myself this friday and that is inherently a romance film. Maybe a bit lonely but I dont actually have ppl to watch it with.

Ironically I said my brother would get a girlfriend before I did and he is 5 years younger. Turned out to be true. Whats more is that apparently our tastes are very similar and I am being a bad person again being jealous of him XD.

I struggle with those thoughts sometimes that I am not actually good or nice but rather selfish and self-serving.

* [Here's some of the food I got](http://imgur.com/a/WwVS4) at the OC Fair last weekend. 

* My friends now call me the Three-Eyed Raven because I keep reading the leaks and spoiling the show for them.

u/Senario-,"Hmm I enjoy movies, games, tv, and anime I guess for hobbies. I keep up with enough popular shows to get by in a conversation (currently on the game of thrones train) I do enjoy eating out and good food in general though I can't eat a ton anymore. And if I had more time I would definitely love to learn to cook more as I do like making good food as well. Something about ppl enjoying the food you make is really satisfying.

Don't have the money for dance lessons but it was on my list of maybe I will try later. (Probably formal).

I guess the unfortunate thing is that I look pretty ok now but I still feel like I am the same slightly chubby and awkward guy inside. I don't think that is something that will solve itself soon. I've also noticed people are being more friendly with me and I honestly don't know how to react or if it is because I look better now or I am just meeting nice people. Either way if it was anything romantic I dunno how to flirt well anyway XD.

I guess my hobbies aren't really too social and there are very few women in the hobbies relative to men though that's changing fast. The girls I have met who are into the two biggest interests (games and anime) are usually taken or not interested.

Funny story, I was at an Asian American market thing with friends and lots of good food about two months ago and I felt like I was getting along (in a friendly/fun way) with one girl but I found out by the end of the night she was married already lol so anything beyond that was immediately gone. The other girls in the group didn't want to talk to me either rip XD. That said her husband is a cool guy who likes one of the more major anime that I like.

u/Jajamola88,"What kind of good are we even trying to accomplish here? the removal of AA would put a LOT of other PoC in jeopardy and besides, taking away AA won't even remove all the anti-Asian racism inherent in holistic admissions. The entire American college application process was designed to weed out a different high-achieving but ""undesirable"" minority (Jewish students) and it's still being used the same way. 

Holistic admissions are rooted in Western ideals of education (quasi-religious dedication, learning for learning's sake, the liberal arts) that run counter to the Asian student who lives in white people's heads (incapable of true passion, animalistic priorities, only good at ""hard"" fields like math or engineering). 

Most of the admissions strategies you'll see on Chinese-language forums are things like ""do an art portfolio to prove you're creative"" or ""put your kid in a writing camp"". Writing about your family or heritage is totally out of the question because the last thing you need to do is remind the admissions officers that you're a goddamn chink. 

I was pretty much raised for the sake of college admissions and I was smack dab in a hyper-competitive school filled with other kids like me. It was a traumatizing, mind-numbing experience. I'm still slowly unlearning all of the self-hatred and paranoia that was ground into me so I could stand a chance against some lazy white bitch who got to have an actual adolescence with family and trips to the mall and romance and whatever people are supposed to do. My parents made it very clear that I was not allowed to relax, ever, because I was Asian and I couldn't afford it. My Asian heritage became nothing more than a speedbump on the road to Harvard. 


**Affirmative action sets arbitrary numerical hoops that you have to jump through. Holistic admissions teach Asian children that being Asian is a shameful disease.** 

Getting rid of AA will do absolutely fuck all to a system that hates us to its core. And if we're gonna go down the ""work with people who hate you uwu"" path, Asian Americans as a community cannot afford to alienate other PoC or reinforce the idea that we're white (no matter how flimsy the reasoning). People are heads-over-heels in love with the narrative of a sniveling, mindless Asian who would do anything for a quick buck. We can't get away with stuff that reinforces that because we just don't have the fucking numbers to create social change on our own, especially when language barriers and the constant erasure of Asian Americans' very existence are still big problems.

**TL;DR affirmative action's repeal would mean very little in an admissions system that's fundamentally antisemitic/anti-Asian and I don't feel like becoming the rhetorical version of the Asian Nazi at Charlottesville**",15,2017-10-05 03:20:57,asianamerican,t3_7481yg,t1_dnxalpp,dnxf6pu,"0"

u/Thienan567,"The offensive nature of cultural appropriation comes from a place of ignorance, the same place of ignorance that leads to someone saying that you, personally, should do ancestor worship. 

It comes from stereotyping elements of a particular culture, or stripping away the importance of highly placed symbols and artifacts in the originating culture. In both cases, the meaning behind the gesture taken from the original culture has been lost, distorted, or intentionally dumped. 

How is it offensive? Let's take the classic example, the bindi.

The bindi, in Hindu culture, is seen as a symbol of incredible religious significance. It is not a symbol to be taken lightly, and therefore it is not to be used as a fashion statement. Wearing the bindi to say ""oh look at me im so worldly and accepting xd"", in many cases highlights the exact opposite, which is the wearer's almost deliberate ignorance. Basically, you're a fucking poser, and it shows. If you want to wear the bindi, a good start is probably seeking out a local Hindu community to learn and discuss it.

Generally, the easiest way to recognize cultural appropriation is occurring is if the culture, or its elements, are sold as a capitalist product. Not saying ""Capitalist is bad, down with the bourgeoisie!"", but as everyone knows, capitalism cares about money and nothing else. So of course it wouldn't care about the meaning of cultural artifacts. Is there a case where a culture is being sold without appropriation occurring?

u/notablossombombshell,"N. here, reporting back with a rundown of what I've been up to on the dating circuit. So! With the boys, more often than not, I've been using my cheat-y tip contribution trick (XD) although~ there is a young guy whom I plan on treating because he's fresh out of school. And a woman I'm seeing where we take turns covering the bill. Which is nice.

Anyway, there's a man I've been thinking of bumping out of my rotation, but I'm reluctant because we have chemistry and he's *gorgeous* and the whole shebang. And I have trouble dropping him 'cause maybe I could give him a chance to prove himself? So far on our outings I've paid my own way, so I definitely don't feel like I owe him a cent. (And so far I haven't had problems handling goodbyes with guys who did treat my portion of dinner, so I'm feeling good about that not becoming an issue yet.) The problem is, among other potentialities, that he's blasian and I'm not, and he's openly remarked on how he wishes he had hair (texture and length) like mine. Also, I now know that his previous girlfriends were East Asian or white. But he's only had a couple LTRs, so it's mainly the hair comment that is flagging as a problem that I can't (shouldn't?) try to fix, and maybe I ought to walk away.

What I am glad for...is that he phrased it as something to do with himself; it was a comment that didn't talk about black women or hypothetical kids or anything of the sort. And I do get that his desire has something to do with a certain heritage aesthetic being so far out of reach? He wishes he had hair like mine in the context of the hairstyles I've modeled, with hair pulled back or in a topknot, stuff like that. To have flowing hair...yeah it's nice; I like my hair the way it is. Should I remind him it's also nice to have texture where intricate patterns work really well on the scalp? Wouldn't that be kinda presumptuous of me to say? We're still basically strangers.

How do I explain this? ""I like you a lot, but you've got hints of self-hate to work through, and I can't be around for that."" Maybe, maybe not? I want to be honest if he asks. This isn't the usual talk to have, several meetups in, and self-hatred is quite an accusation, though I do think we all deal with it to a certain extent, don't we. Over the summer, I had a little reminder of my own. I was walking around in the dark when I mis-estimated the location of a wall and careened smack into it face first. In my panic, what's my first thought? Hope my nose isn't broken all crooked now? Nope; I desperately wanted to be sure that my nose wasn't *flattened*, is the way that thought ran through my mind.

I didn't even hit the wall that hard. I just heard inside my head what sounded like the cartilage crunch, and the impact did hurt some. The bridge of my nose stayed tender for weeks, though there were no external signs of bruising. And I'm guessing everything bounced back, as far as I can tell. But wow, what a scare. Really brought out my buried insecurities there. (We Chinese folks, we fixate on nose bridges like Anglos do with cheekbones.) After the convo with that guy I'm reminded of this, and I'm reminded, also, of my college ex.

She and I had parted ways on a soft note. (I still reminisce.) Although I was firm about having no plans to look her up, a couple years later she found me on social media, and faithfully I began to follow along to her online journal, giving occasional input while trying (hard) to stay on the correct side of boundaries I'd intended to draw. My ex spilled plenty of thoughts on that blog. Including, yes, how she felt regarding how she looked. It was often meta - self-hatred did not go unrecognized; simply put, triggers happened, and they happened quite frequently. I began to dread checking back, and still I kept reading. I would leave comments where I could, but I knew that there was nothing really I could say. Perhaps if we looked alike, I could've said more, empathically, light-heartedly, whatever have you. As is...what could I say? I thought I was clever to inform her that I'd spotted someone cool who reminded me of her. Not sure that had any effect.

I started tapering down the communication after I heard she was single again. Didn't know how to stick around without letting things get awkward. Don't know if I'd still have the resolve to tell her, for the third time, I'd love to catch-up sometime in person...eventually. That the idea of a reunion is something I'd like to keep in my back pocket indefinitely. 'cause I still don't want to be friends. Not while the thought of her haunts me still.

u/Jajamola88,"PUA tactics are misogynistic by nature because they treat relationships as a battlefield where you have to deceive women into liking you and the general idea of ""having' a woman is more important than actually...liking a person in particular. This mode of thinking is totally reliant on a concept of masculinity where a man's worth is measured by how he can ""own"" a woman. Why do you think terms like ""trophy wife"" exist?

Honestly, his website is relatively tame compared to some of the stuff that happens on...adjacent subreddits, but he's still openly taking advantage of troubled men and telling them the best way to resolve shit is to get a girl into a relationship loaded with ulterior motives. 

Misogyny aside, it's just a godawful attitude towards human interactions and a dude that makes his living off this bullshit isn't an unbiased source or a good debate partner. He is not selling his services to just any frustrated Asian guy: he is aiming for Asian guys who want to ""reclaim"" their masculinity and demand ""allyship"" from the Asian feminists they slander as Nazis or white men's sex slaves or eugenicists or race traitors or whatever the fuck you guys learned from your alt-right buddies. 

The vast majority of men are well-adjusted, normal fucking people who desire (physical and emotional) intimacy with others and romantic fulfillment, because that's how humans work. PUA self-help programs(?) do not have that kind of fulfillment in mind, they are fundamentally ego-boosters built on the idea that women are just tools for a man to craft his public image.

u/Where2cop857,"I ain’t gonna lie, I can see some Asian chicks using those labels lol

However,

I passionately listen to 2003-2008 rap and r&amp;b (gen z stuff is mostly garbage) but I actually talk to hoodrats unlike some Asians I know who listen to hood shit but hang with Asians primarily 

Id shop at farmers markets but I can never wake up or remember but have shopped at WF for almost a decade now lol.

I used to lift/run but I’m kinda in the mental health field which is pretty much female dominated nowadays

I’m into fashion, shop at Barneys, eat dece upscale food /Chinatown from time to time when I can .. which are pretty Asian clientele nowadays

Never had any labels thoas much as I want to embrace them.. but I’m an Asian guy idk xD

edit: The thing I see with lib Asian American chicks who are labeled like that is because imo in appearance they seemingly do things in a categorical vacuum

Tho it can be that I’m from the northeast and that I can never top the whiteness of the old money whities. And again no one is really white here per se as the Anglo “WASP” Brahmins rule the racial and sociocoeocnomic class structure here.

I’ve been to D.C. and Alexandra, VA a decade ago recognizing them as liberal “accent-free” havens...but talking to CSRs and online people in the non-metro parts I’m taken aback by their slight Southern accent compared to the New England Establishment Yankee accent.

Anyways cool story to hear about the AA developments of the south. However I like my Northeast (NYC/New England) Yankee-esque (faux-yuppie) life even if it means AAs are vastly outnumbered as the minority group in shaping local demographics here.

u/Where2cop857,"I’m starting to get over the mental health biomedical research world in Boston. I shared my drafted resignation letter for the consumer advocate advisory group I’m in. Unfortunately a lot of my theoretical psych school of thought lies with the “NYC school” (think more dynamic psychiatry vs. biological psychiatry; integrative/psychodynamic psychotherapy vs. short-term CBT/strengths-based/supportive) 

However, I’m still sticking to my new volunteer role as Treasuer for this officeless ~quarter-century mental-health NPO. We’re playing to attend a MH walk together in Manhattan come May at a “competing” NYC-led NPO.

I’ve offered to suggest implementing cloud-based solutions (Dialpad VoIP, G-Suite, Square Payments, Quickbooks/Donor:Me, Squarespace, secondary business bank for redundancy/better technological functions, etc.) to reduce our delayed overhead and increase productivity.

But baby boomers man.... 😤

I also declined being a “runway model” for some local Asian fashion event. Some whack Asian female-focused NPO executive director grabbed my contact after hearing me talk/saw me/attend a conference seeing that’s I’m Asian...involuntarily misconstrued my nice greeting and signed me to work for her NPO and link up with another Asian dude peer mentor. I did the polite email exchange but never pursed it. Then shortly last year and then this year she Cc’s me to submit my body measurements. 🙄

I talked to a psychiatrist who moderated the AA talk I wasn’t in about this lady and he came to the conclusion that’s she is a bit forward and ambitiously/ involuntarily signs people up for her NPO crusade without the schmoozing/wine and dining for volunteer talent.

While NPOs are a “legit” industry here in Boston, most of them try to aggressively solicit you free volunteer labor it seems. F that.

Anyways, on more lighter note, I hung out with a friend and my acquaintence/his acquaintances last Friday. We met up at this dive bar where I used grow up walking past all the time. I get there early and it was cool af! They hadn’t plenty of Elvis memorabilia. Luckily, as unplanned and unresearched beforehand, I wore my rocker jean jacket because I the folks are the rocker/musician types. The waitstaff was great as we talked about the famous local Americana vintage shop nearby in the neighborhood and they used Chinese bowls! I’m trying to go back later and tip her more (my friend paid) as I felt we took up too much space waiting for others as there were other patrons waiting. Def felt welcomed and want to be a regular.

After a college apartment get together, we all went to this LGBT friendly club. The crowd was fine but obviously got sterile for me coz I’m hetero. Music was great but I felt the crowd could have been more bougie and lively...but the actual dance room was small and the restaurant-dining layout was weird. I didn’t get hit on or groped by the ghey bros tho as it seemed everyone kept to their clique/date which was good. 

Anyways, I need another NYC trip soon just to blow off Boston steam. Through an IG connect, I figured out where the Manhattan Chinatown to Atlantic City/Sands Bethalam is finally. Maybe hit it up and play a Borgata tournament and try to network into NYC underground games for inevitable move someday... xD",3,2018-03-30 16:03:29,asianamerican,t3_88b27p,t3_88b27p,dwjafz0,"0"

u/Where2cop857,"Weebo and Waifus, I present you [Harvard Medical School](https://imgur.com/a/4Dk6keS). XD I was here to attend a memoiral for a famed principal investigator.

Conversely, yesterday I had a spat with my psychiatric nurse practitioner and walked-out on him after not seeing him for like 6 months. My diagnosis is still unclear and he is too medical model reductionist, full of projecting Jewish homosexual practitioner bias (keeps bringing up my “handsome appearance” and etc. dating, and doesn’t entertain for talking things out.

1yr no psychiatric med(s) tho. It was a subclinical dosage anyways, especially for me being Asian where studies have shown antipsychotics metabilize slower than other races.

I’m also thinking about talking to my PI to remove myself as an author for this research study I’m apart of. I don’t think I support it anymore...that Boston area HMS/MIT-McGovern/Biopharma medical model reductionism here...perhaps it’s time to pack up to relocate to NYC for more psychoanalytic schools of thought/better psychodynamic considerations of the mind/psychopathology. At least Columbia/Cornell has psychoanalytic schools built-in to their medical school psychiatry departments. ☺️",1,2018-05-11 16:44:05,asianamerican,t3_8ioitq,t3_8ioitq,dythcgj,"0"

u/Pikangie,"It is strange for me to hear about Filipino food ""becoming trendy"" because I grew up in a city in USA that is majority Filipino demographic... so to me it is like, ""is something like Lumpia not really known elsewhere in US?"", it's something that is just so normal for me and my family, even though only my cousin and aunt are actually Filipino, the rest of us are Chinese and/or Japanese lol.

​

But yeah I can understand that too... Like for me, it does get kind of annoying how some people will be like, ""Oh I LOVE Japanese food!"" but they only like Ramen and plain Onigiri, and get grossed out by and refuse to try octopus, jellyfish, fish roe, pork intestine soup, etc... Some I know don't even like staples of Japanese cuisine like seaweed, tofu, fishcake, or anything with dashi/mirin/soy sauce (which is like nearly all Japanese food). Well I don't really blame them for being grossed out as pig intestine soup lol (plus that's more of Okinawan cuisine), but yeah. They basically say they love a culture's food so much, and end up only really liking like 1% of the actual food and not want to try other things because it's not ""American"" enough. XD

Same with Chinese food, especially in smaller towns that don't have authentic Chinese restaurants like where I live in rural Texas, how many probably only like the Panda Express menu food, claim to love Chinese food, but will probably refuse majority of an authentic Chinese restaurant's menu and see Dim Sum as some alien thing lol.",2,2018-08-23 23:18:17,asianamerican,t3_99nsze,t1_e4pngjp,e4q1do5,"0"

u/Siantlark,"So short answer, No still no evidence ecks dee. 

Ok, 2 things since I can't actually read the study and check the methodology (And you, presumably, have read and understood the study and can answer the questions.) 

Was this study done on Western women? 

And if so, 

Did they account for cultural differences and social construction of male attractiveness? Ie: Did they manage to specifically link their findings to evolutionary factors, instead of, say, Western ideals of male attractiveness and masculinity? 

EDIT: 

Oh wait, your WashPo article literally points this out. 

&gt;Dunsworth said that despite the study's straightforward methods, she did not find the authors' evolutionary explanations in the paper convincing. “They made no link between any of those responses of those women to any sort of ancient, deep-seated evolutionary traits,” she said.

&gt;She pointed out that the results might not be universal. The raters were college-age women evaluating the appearance of college-age men. They might not “have much of an experience with what attractiveness means,” Dunsworth said. The study authors also acknowledged that physical attraction to someone's body, after all, is only one set of cues we use when appraising partners.

&gt;“It’s my opinion that the authors are too quick to ascribe a causal role to evolution,” said Lisa Wade, a sociologist at Occidental College in Los Angeles. “It's nothing unique to them. Much of this type of research has the same methodological problems.”

In contrast, what I'm really not into are the Asians that normalize this by claiming that their parents' overfeeding/early bedtime/anti-dating shticks are simply their ways of expressing affection. I don't care if they pay my way into retirement—I know for a fact that *not* all Asian parents are unapproving, oblivious narcissists.

But it is sad! Even in Japan for girls... Jennie is the Japan counterpart of Barbie, and yet she is also white American transfer student with blonde hair, according to her bio.

So the only Asian Doll I ever had as a kid, actually I was a teenager already when they released Bratz dolls and there was one named Jade. But it was very cartoony style so the only really noticeably ""Asian"" thing was her black hair and name implying her to be Chinese American. XD

When I was younger I remember feeling more related to the Black American doll than to the blonde White American doll. Even though I am light skinned Asian lol. I just really wanted a doll with black hair like my own! And only the Black American dolls had black hair before Jade of Bratz.",12,2019-01-08 07:33:37,asianamerican,t3_adoieg,t1_edj0yuz,edjpruu,"0"

u/envatted_love,"Two reasons, one more obvious than the other.

* More obvious: There *a lot* of Asian-language-background people, especially Chinese.

* Less obvious: Chinese names are more concentrated than names in many other languages. That is, the top `n` Chinese names account for a higher percentage of Chinese-named people than the top `n` (say) Italian names do for Italian-named people.

Result: With Chinese names, the top few names account for a large percentage (reason 2) of a large number (reason 1).

What's behind reason 2? I've read a theory^^^1 that societies with earlier state formation have less surname diversity. Explanation: Surnames only get formalized after state formation (the only reason to formalize surnames in the first place is taxation across multiple villages; otherwise something like ""Bill the blacksmith"" works just fine), and surname diversity falls over time as families combine. The example I remember is a contrast between Turkish names (formalized in the 20th century) and Korean (formalized much earlier).

^^^1 I don't remember exactly where, but I think it was in connection with [John C. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott)'s book [*Seeing Like a State*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/).",27,2019-04-12 09:30:34,asianamerican,t3_bcabub,t3_bcabub,ekp95dh,"0"

&gt; They side with GOP because the Republicans backed the war 


Another big thing is taxes and welfare(well, that's the main reason for my self centered family. The communist point is just the #1 fall back excuse- classic GOP strategy)


My shady family haaaates welfare^^^but ^^^it's ^^^only ^^^ok ^^^if ^^^they ^^^collect ^^^it


They constantly bitch about how much they pay in taxes while cheating taxes. Lying about the wife being a no income/stay-at-home when she has her own station(which goes into a new hilarious shady situation about her trying to collect unemployment w/covid bonus, but worried about being busted for lying on taxes for decades


A few weeks back the family gossip was how so-and-so got free govt money(almost 100k) in free gov't money from PPP. 

Guess what the result of the application was? yup loans. They had the balls to be pissed off about the PPP loans not being free handouts. Literally bitched to my parents that they didn't want a 'stupid loan'



----


Fake being paper poor so they and their parents can collect government welfare and so they don't have to pay for health insurance^(while yelling medicare for all is communist!). Plus get that free senior housing(that she doesnt even live in- she lives at home and just has this apt on the side ) and eventual free nursing home(like what they did to one of the grandpas)


Collecting elderly parent's social security and food stamps + food bank pantry items in their fancy schmancy lexus

The new thing is hitting up several of those pop up food bank pantries with 3 people(=3 bags), multiple times a week(when it's supposed to be 1 household=1 bag per week) 

while foisting the old expired and unwanted food bank stuff on everyone else so they don't have to throw it away themselves- collecting that good ole buddhist karma of non-waste. Guess who's the new owner of 2 tubs of expired cottage cheese!

----


They've emulated GOP talking point of calling everything they don't like communist


Also just like GOP, they've shown their authoritarian side with all these protests (like it's totally ok that the police are using violence. They deserve what they get! They should go to jail. If this was Vietnam or China, they would be put to death bla bla blah. they really got a thing for capital punishment)

u/artrockenthusiast,"I’m Japanese and trans male, I agree with this. Japanese Americans don’t speak Japanese and have names like « Bob » and « Susan » because their culture was persecuted out of them in internment. Even in Japan, we were all taught from birth that being « « American » » » (read: white American) was fancier and better than being us, and that Ryukyuan people (esp women) being terrorised by the bases didn’t matter because America was perfect and better than us. 

I have faced and continue to face violence for speaking Japanese/not being a native English speaker, from teachers pulling me out of my seat by my hair and admin laughing about it in high school to a group claiming to want to “”help immigrants uwu”” cornering me and a friend against a window in Starbucks for speaking our native language, as immigrants will do, to look at all the anti-Asian hate crimes and murders right now.

If you were hapa, or were raised in Japan in a Japanese-speaking household or something, that’d be different. But you’re just playing dress-up in a culture that real people from that culture get hurt for belonging to. 

And I’ll be the first to admit when picking a new first name, that I didn’t pick it the traditional Japanese way, but based on other metrics (for example, I wanted something memorialising my granpa on the Japanese side, so one kanji is from his favourite season of the year. I also wanted something with plausible gender neutrality because I feared for safety and I wasn’t sure how much changes T was gonna make starting it in my 30s, those were the sort of metrics I used, which is not really traditional method of choosing) but I *am* hapa, raised mostly by my Japanese side in Hyougo, and to be honest, the white side of my family is *among* the people who did racially motivated violence to me. 

If none of the violence done to Asians (which has always been happening, the only change is news started *admitting* it this February—literally the system of modern immigration was created by America to do violence to people coming from Asia) it would be different, but Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants don’t get to be Japanese, or at least not safely, so yes, this is offensive.",9,2021-07-02 18:22:14,asianamerican,t3_obwajm,t1_h3qu3ac,h3u1u77,"0"
u/artrockenthusiast,"I’ve got something not entirely dissimilar with my career. All I want to do is serve the people who need it the most (social work) among those, Asian and Latino clients, like workers, are treated worse than rabid stray dogs. I mean actual segregation, forced servitude of the infirm, and violence. Every time over the past 17 years, I’ve just gone down with my clients, unable to help, because the left wants to pretend it’s not exactly like the right when it comes to POC/queer people/etc. they don’t consider “valid.” 

I could go on forever , but all I’ll say is you going down like this when you’re the one that seems to really see Lucy (I suggest you Google “parental alienation” for some reading about the phenomenon that seems to be going on with her vs her parents, especially Tracy) and everyone except your grandparents…no, this isn’t fair to you. 

I mean, hey, I’m aware that as someone on literally every axis of “oppression of your group is anti-oppression I’m totally not just like the GOP uwu” that my moral compass is kind of informed by *identifying with* the rejects of the rejects of the rejects. You know, I’m from a Japanese sect of Buddhism founded because after decades of anguish, its founder realised we can’t all be Buddha. Not trying to prostelytise (whatever), but just saying, even if there’s some selfishness in your love for Lucy? There’s some “I want” in everything. People *have* babies because they want. People get married or even someone like me picking my career for the right reasons (you’d be horrified how many people in America pick this field to have someone to lourd themselves over), they may be the right ones, but they’re not completely unselfish.

What I see is you see Lucy. You’re the one with the right motivation here. I can’t get a read on everyone or why they’ve all decided you’re on whatever side isn’t theirs, and I can’t say how to cope with going down for doing the right thing except not even being able to do anything in the end because I’m in in career crisis mode again (my old friend) because the guy who is not and is racist to Asians and Latinos like all the others who disappears for three hours on the clock to go shopping and stuff that I got in trouble having to stay a half hour over once due to his absence and they know it, is a better worker than me, who doesn’t deny all services whatsoever to or do violence to Asian and Latino clients. Who I now cannot reach or help. Like every place before this. 

I see the same in your situation. I don’t have advice, but it’s not fair, you’re in the right, and it’s not your fault.

u/artrockenthusiast,"More feedback; I live in Oakland, near SF.

It gave one match in Fullerton, then the other two matches were near Lis Angeles, which the shortest highway route with no traffic in either the SF or LA metro areas, is six hours by highway. It needs to be broken into region, not just state. California’s at least *as* long as Japan. 

Now, I do know Japanese therapists exist in other areas of my region (notably Silicon Valley, which is still too far for a public transit user), and none of the three results it gave me were Japanese people despite me marking that as important.

Though, in the end, I could only select one most important factor. I would’ve liked to select that cost, language (a. Written English better than spoken, b. English is a language of violence to us. I actually also prefer Spanish in general if no Japanese is available), AND shared experience were all equally important, but I could only pick one.

I did like that I could select Japanese AND mixed. My non-Japanese side being white supremacists against me and my dad both is part of my trauma all caused by being Asian in America, and I suspect a lot of mixed race AsAms feel the same even if it wasn’t that severe. I know a lot of people fetishise even the idea of mixed children over here and this is perfectly OK, because one drop of Asian blood=no longer human!

Anyway, there were some other ones where even if I’d wanted to put multiple, the thing changed page as soon as I hit one. 

I’m trans and was formerly bi, but due to trauma because Asians and trans men are both considered less desirable than a sack of manure unless the other person is looking for someone to abuse, I’m now aromantic due to trauma (called Caedromantic, and Caedsexual exists, too, if this is anyone else, considering our race is targeted for rape and this is considered OK) There’s SO many terms, but stuff like “bi” (bisexual or biromantic), “pan” (pansexual or panromantic) (these two could also be together under “bi+”) and “aro/ace” (aromantic and asexual) could probably stand to be there. You can have differing romantic versus sexual orientations (eg, I used to actually be biromantic asexual, though I didn’t exactly have a lot of info when I came out in the ‘90s, and just identified as “bisexual, sex is not a priority” (which hey, I did not understand what sexual attraction really was because everyone was kinda assumed straight or “f—-ot” in ‘90s FL) 

I was also thinking you might wanna put trans in gender and have “cis male” “trans male” “cis female” “trans female” and maybe just cover NB bases with “agender” “trans masculine” “transfeminine” “NB gender native to my heritage” (a lot of our old/ancestral countries had those before colonialism destroyed our queer communities. Japan, China, South and Central Asia, etc, all had them, and in the revival of NB genders, people are more openly identifying with these as well as the Anglophone ones) 

One button asked if I wanted to discuss “LGBTQ+ issues (Orientation)” I was extremely confused because “T” is “trans,” which identity is not orientation. The conflation of the two, again, started with EuroAmerica normalising queerphobia. So I was unclear on what the button meant. And cisgays, especially white cisgays, but not only just, love to turn around and bash the rest of the rainbow here. Usually AsAm cisgays are fine, but yanno, that’s probably something to consider a person’s comfort level or provide a good match. And even lumping all trans people together—trans women are literally considered the only ones worthy of helping. All other trans people, from trans men to AMAB NB, are basically treated in queer matters the way Asians are in race. That extreme violence and lack of places to get help is “your PrIvElEdGe because you just oppress yourselves and aren’t real people!!! Aren’t I so different from the right wing uwu???” Plus my abusive ex-wife whose abuse I’m still reeling from recloseted me while making me pay for her hormones among the beating, starving, poisoning, rape, etc., and again, “trans” resources may deny you for not being sufficiently trans if you are not a binary trans woman the end. And literally no one cares, because just like Asians. 

Also, NB resources may actually be “NB is basically a woman, all NB is is a skinny white girl with a clown-coloured mohawk” That may be my opinion on Milennial hairstyles in general, but so many things pretend to be NB but only allow AFAB NB of a certain mould and then misgender them because they’re NBphobic, basically TERF sort of tactics. 

There are a lot of queer community things to separate out—you can’t lump us all together, and I’m sure I’ve missed plenty, but that’s what I know, and hopefully you can implement this somehow in helping refine matching. 

Lastly, two populations I noticed weren’t on there, the SF Peninsula has a HUGE Filipino population. Still some here, too, but formerly pan-Asian Chinatown has been being bulldozed for any old thing the city wants to do since the ‘50s because “no real people live there.” (Though the story of how my church, the only remaining thing of Japantown, survived is a wild story of perseverance. I digress, though) so a lot of people got run out, and a lot of Filipinos are now across the Bay.

Also, barring all the ICE raids that no one cared about because Wrong Race, (though honestly, no one  really cares about those internment camps for Latinos, either for same reason), there’s a pretty big population of Cambodians. Some speak Khmer, some don’t, the ones who don’t are more likely to be among those who commit suicide when deported. Their surviving families definitely need support.

Both groups also have decent numbers near Stockton or Sacramento, which I’ve only been to Sacramento once (there’s a Little Manila but I was there on business, I don’t know anything else) and I’ve never been to Stockton. Anyway, these groups, I don’t *think* I saw them there. 

Are you just doing E/SE, or how much of Asia and diaspora does this cover? Because we have a sizeable Desi population centred around Fremont—I’m not sure about language spread because India has at least 90 languages, I think, though also like PRC and Mandarin, India have an official one, which is Hindi, and we have not only West Asian Arabic speakers (mind you, Arabic dialects are not quite as divided as the languages of China, but they’re not like English or even Spanish dialects—though all literate in Arabic should know Modern Standard, so I dunno how much of an issue this is) we also have a good number of Central Asians, particularly Persian/Farsi speakers, but I’ve met Mongolians, too, here.

u/artrockenthusiast,"Was just there today. Don’t go there much because of the 90 degree inclines… but yeah, it’s completely different from the mid-2000s—all this super luxury stuff clearly catering to white tourists and giving them showmanship lessons on tea or whatever (reads exactly like Benihana to me, and I’m sure there are the same fake “savage Asian” scare stories about these places somewhere) 

Chinatown Oakland, or, well, what’s even left—racist Laney College was the reason half of it was demolished, my church, the only surviving thing of neighbouring Japantown has a legendary story of being cut in two and moved in the middle of the night mere hours before the very active church was set to be demolished for the overpass, and at least it’s still Asian, and despite losing the cosy carpet and armchairs, Chinatown library is AMAZING, but the plaza was built after everything there being ripped up for the BART bendy tunnel. Chinatown Oakland was very pan-Asian, but all these chopping it to bits because “real people don’t live there uwu” chased everyone out. 

These days, even the remaining longtime shopkeeps bus in. Or have been pushed to places like Hotel Oakland (senior SROs, where AHS clinic was when it was a tiny one room clinic. AHS is the one thing that has just grown. It’s amazing. Very good. I will always call the one clinic site “Silver Dragon,” though) 

SF Chinatown… OK, yeah, when I was there today, I couldn’t help but think it had a bit of a Manhattan or LA Chinatown… “for tourists, not local Asians” vibe going. (Though LA’s only had exactly one grocery store in the 2010s, and Ai Hoa shut down since I came back here, and there are still a good few grocers in SF if you go left of Grant)

And I’ve only ever seen one “daily goods store,” and I saw it today. Otherwise, it’s souvenir shops as far as the eye can see. 

I’ve begun going there for specific whitening toothpaste and a very specific herbal shampoo, and just odds and ends I can’t find in Oakland or Oakland stores can’t get back in stock, etc. But yeah, it really does look like it’s starting to slip to “””Japantown””” which has stuff like “K-Pop Beauty Coffee,” which makes zero sense, but just like the abrupt cuts, stuffing with cartoon related shows and advertising “70% of our Japanese programming viewers are AmErIcAn” in English before swapping to Korean programming from both KTSF 26 and KTLA 18 in SoCal, and shoot, the big wave of Koreans was in the 80s, and Koreatown the whole time I was out there was white yuppie Airbnb “artist community” children’s bunk beds, and on Korean news, every day it seemed another Korean elder was violently beaten and mugged, and there’s still new Japanese immigrants in not-Oakland parts of the Bay, but it’s never been about Japanese or Koreans, but who today’s Disposable Income holders want to consume, and while it’s not like how people in Japantown stores just have to “look Asian for the tourists” and few actually speak Japanese, I can’t help but feel like LA Chinatown and now SF Chinatown are showing early signs of trending the same way.

And Oakland. What I just said about housing and there’s now some “Oakland Photo Shop” or something that doesn’t even have a Google Translate signs like used to be when Chase and a couple other things moved in (the signage is gone) I mean there’s the new market with a good few Latinos, but there are also Chinese people there and Latinos have always been good to Asians. That’s different. 

But yes, Asians have been being run out of Asian neighbourhoods for decades (not even getting into all the mass lynchings and otherwise murders of Chinese railroad workers, replacements for slavery to begin with, and barred from bringing spouses and families, from the 1860s, basically the moment they started coming, until about the 1910s, I think, and the total destruction of Japanese communities as they were due to internment, or the 37 Korean shop owners killed quietly in LA at encouragement of mass media leading up to the ‘92 riots) 

This has been happening since the moment Asians got here. It’s nothing new. We’re just allowed to talk about it beyond quiet whispers when no one else is around. And the pot hasn’t boiled in a good few decades. It’s boiling again. That’s all.",25,2021-08-29 01:57:35,asianamerican,t3_pddwjc,t1_haptny7,har6v1o,"0"
u/artrockenthusiast,"If I do something Japanese and don’t know every piece of US pop culture ever and obscure Japanese words not used since the capital was moved to Edo (linguistic shift means this is less like Shakespeare to English and closer to *Beowulf* to English), I’m a failure and an idiot, but a white or black person spends a month in Japan or learns the word “sushi,” and are qualified to whitesplain to me my entire culture (which is 100% whatever they make up) because I’m too stupid to know the country I grew up in because “I’m from Japan” is immediately respondable to with “How was Chah-ner?” 

I live in “So ProGreSsIvE uwu” SF Bay Area and this really is as good as they get. As English only opens opportunity for 438 bottom rung positions and some barely literate monolingual younger than you who sleeps his entire shift is more valued than you and Taco Bell Mchdispgjroq  SnuffleWixzsg III Jr is a more respectable name than Yamada Tarou, I seriously do lately miss the days when at least I couldn’t understand all the hate spewed my way. Literally learning Cantonese because I realised I was pushed to assimilate to the wrong culture and a culture that will never be satisfied with assimilation and welcome me. Shoot, also, “Koreatown” Oakland is even worse of a joke than Japantown—it’s one market and a small plaza a couple blocks down, and Koreatown LA is where white yuppies sell “artist communities” of people crammed in children’s bunk beds through Airbnb while remaining Korean elders, every airing of KTLA Korean news had yet another Korean grandparent brutally mugged. Not to mention the shams of Japantowns and that Japanese and Korean programming and stuff is absolutely all about chasers and not about either of us. 

But yes, your experience is very absolutely normal and it’s still considered OK because we’re still OK to consider subhuman and only for consumption. 

Literally, no pause between “I’m Japanese” and “CHAH-NER” but they know better than me because they went to Benihana once and got K-Pop Beauty Coffee, amirite? 

Half of this is said sarcastically/resentfully at how we’re treated.

u/artrockenthusiast,"Oh, believe me, I know. Those “luxury apartments” that go for 3000$/mo for a box are Airbnb hotels in disguise. There are four or five between me and one of the two nearest BART stations, and all windows from my old job/position 2019-a few months ago faced one in SF. They all have luggage carts in the lobbies because they’re constantly in use. They all also contain the requisite three or whatever “”AfFoRdAbLe””” units, but they’re intentionally kept empty. And those places love to pinkwash or put up plaques for Chauncey Bailey or have some kind of name that’s what “AmErIcAnS” (to differentiate from people who are also American but not allowed to identify as such, like AsAms or LatAms regardless of being descendants of 1860s railroad workers or the people from when CA was part of MX *before* the US decided it was their Anglo Rights [tm], shelving Native Americans for lack of knowledge) think “Chah-neez” sounds like (the same way they think The Language of India is “Indian,” OK, write Mandarin style, and Mandarin and Hindi are the respective official languages, but the difference between Mandarin/Cantonese, which I know a little of both, strike me more like the difference between Japanese and Ryukuan than, say, Hyougo dialect and Akita dialect. I once saw someone talking about people saying “Chinese language” on Tumbler, and they said “OK, you’re gonna have to be more specific in your racism.”) but they are absurdly hyperinflating property values and even the few holdouts like my landlady who genuinely don’t want to raise rent are really having a hard time staying, well, a holdout. And most property owners are not like her. Or just take the money and run, turning it over to white people who fiercely guard the whiteness of the building in the middle of Chinatown. That is now part of the ridiculous “We love the city/neighbourhood we just destroyed uwu area pride!!” 

Just eleven years ago, 900$/mo got you a newly renovated 1LDK in a gated community of mostly Asians and Latinos in the Vietnamese area, walkable to Chinatown, at least before we got SoCal climate.

I also read recently about another one that is “Not A Timeshare!!!” (It’s a timeshare) There are a good few of these companies, but they’re all racing each other to do the same thing—monopolise all the housing ever. Some homeless people who would be able to afford a basic studio in a healthy market live in them. Including in Chinatown, where they then decide it’s their right to chase, bully, and harass the people of the area if they’re not the fierce gatekeeping type. 

What’s even left of the only community I’ve felt at home in since setting foot on this continent is being ripped away from under our feet, and assuming I get to live a full lifespan, between that and we literally had a day with no sunlight late last year because the rains stopped about eight years ago, and this area isn’t used to giant wildfires like Ventura County or whatever is, just, I’m really worried what’s gonna happen to us. Oakland Chinatown is really tenacious. Lots of legendary survival stories. I just see what’s left, it’s still slipping away. And it’s really sped up these last twelve or so years. A lot of the community is 50+. Mostly 70+. I’m a little under both, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people aren’t willing to leave everything they know all over again. My Cantonese isn’t good enough to discuss this, but I wouldn’t be terribly surprised.

I was forced into doing it, it didn’t work. I bailed out and came back incredibly sick and feeling a good thirty years older than my age/when I left here four years prior. (I still feel older than I am, but only by about eight or so years compared to feeling 70 years old in SoCal. I figure this is functional) 

I know everything has to change, but it doesn’t have to always get worse. But it is for us. The only people happy are the paranoid white people who report you for burglary because you were chatting with someone who saw you to your building and bothered their nap or claim there’s absolutely no food around because they’re not creepily sterile aisles and aisles of fake cheese made of “food starch” that doesn’t even melt and burger buns shaped like bald eagles and a special entrance for your bleached and tie-dyed labradoodle that is absolutely not a service animal, this is just a thing now. (I was going for “labrador,” but autocorrect actually got something right!) And the restaurants are “primitive” and “smelly” and “sacrificing animals” because they’re not P.F. Chang’s with Google Translate signage because the whole point is “Asian Aesthetics without having to see actual Asians!” 

Those are the people that are happy. 

Do I understand fear of unsafe neighbourhood??? As much as literally the entire intention behind Volunteer Chinatown Patrol! And that’s actually exactly what I’m saying. *Our* safe spaces are being ripped out from under us. Literally everywhere except places like Compton are safe for white people, there’s tonnes of 3/5 Compromise places (basically the role of the Electoral College these days. Long Beach law prevents gerrymandering minority neighbourhoods’ votes away. Except Cambodia town is split into five pieces that are absorbed by surrounding areas. Voter ID laws, so on, so on. Why is this minority vote worth amplifying when no one else’s is??) where all they’d be displacing is corn. (Which hey, even Asians and Latinos in my area, because concentrated sugar is hidden in everything ever, every other person seems to have type two diabetes from my age up. It’s even taken over Japanese foods since I left. Since they make it from corn for some reason, maybe we could stand to have a little less. Go back to non-concentrated sugars) there’s so much land out there—they have choices. They don’t have to run us out. They fled to and made the suburbs and just decided they wanted to displace us for giggles and leave us to look towards their scraps, except not even, because the Not Timeshare and yuppie group homes companies are buying the suburbs. 

Actually, Lisbon, Portugal banned Airbnb and the like, and the market stability and the people returned and everything was fixed. Just, it would be “gay” to learn from something, “socialist” to learn from another country, and ""ruin culture"" to actually *do* something that helps people instead of spewing vagaries to get congratulated while making sure no improvement happens.

Sketch was talking about BBC pulling both sidesism on science, and following interview with dentist up with someone who pulls teeth with string and a door.

u/artrockenthusiast,"I was one of three Asians in all of Florida. (FotB was, for the most part, optimistic rather than realistic, but they were absolutely right about the fact that if you find another Asian family, you are legally obligated to be friends www) The internet was comprised of teens’ Geocities pairing shrines, university Information Tech department pages, places you could download the latest Backstreet Boys single if you owned the computer and didn’t need the phone for eight hours. In fact, the only reason where I worked in ‘02 even *had* a computer was to use Microsoft Publisher to compose flyers, which would then be printed and made available in a rack by the door. Us Asians were completely smothered and refused airtime and then gaslit about “being silent uwu” until this past February. A big part of what’s letting us push back is the modern shape of the Internet. Harnessing the Internet is how George Takei got America to stop denying internment and stop encouraging the classmates of Japanese high schoolers to beat them up over Pearl Harbour for extra credit like they did in the ‘90s. Not hyperbole. 

So I have no idea, and you’re probably gonna wanna ask someone who lived then fully integrated into an Asian community, like I am here in CA now. 

I myself spoke often about the “pointless blonde remake” (albeit cleaning that up for proper English, what I was trying to convey is exactly what’s now called “whitewashing” ) but yanno, people gaslit me out of saying it.

u/artrockenthusiast,"I am zero percent surprised there’s a whole lot of half-Asian, half-Latino people running around. Not only are our experiences really similar, but I learnt Spanish *ahead* of English on coming here, *despite being here because my non-Japanese side was English-speaking white* (imagine Giuliani, but acts like the worst stereotypes of white trailer owners. That was/is them. Past tense only because a lot of them, as well as all of my Japanese side except me, died years ago) because Latinos were just *nice* to me and accepted me as a fellow immigrant. And to this day, spoken English has never become quite natural to me, but not only do I look racially ambiguous, but I sound completely natural in Spanish and people usually just think I’m Cuban. Including actual Cubans. (I learnt on the East Coast plus I turn my “r”s into “l”s, and that is done in Cuba) Yet, speaking English is still a bit of work. And because of the hostility of its native speakers toward me, feels like a hostile language overall. However, if Japanese isn’t available, Spanish is my go-to. So I’m not at all surprised there are a lot of families formed this way! I actually think this is where we should really focus the bulk of overt solidarity efforts. 

As for “Latine,” you know, it’s a good word when speaking with or about an NB Latino, but outside of that, I hear “Latino is already the gender neutral form as well as the masculine,” and a lot of stuff about using it as in the title header is forcing Anglophonic ideas on Spanish. (Note, I’ve also heard the same about “Filipino”/“Filipina” gramatical gender stuff, but I don’t speak Tagalog and the ongoing gentrification of my formerly very pan-Asian Chinatown, which I’m one of only two or three remaining Japanese people, in more recent years, seems to have driven out most of the Filipinos as well as a lot of the Vietnamese. [Heck, a good number of the Chinese too, which was always happening] This means I no longer much hear about Filipino community stuff) 

I’ve also heard a lot of conflicting info about the “Latinx,” but I’ve never heard that spoken in Spanish, whereas I can readily read ‘Latine’.” 

This actually came up in Ask Latin America the other day, which I follow to read and learn, though I’d heard about this all before. 

There is kind of a similar thing in Japanese in the 21st century, but specifically only where *profession names* were gendered. It more opens things up for men to get jobs as nurses than anything else. Japanese has a *tonne* of gender neutrality built in already. Neutrality is politeness, and even where there is heavily gendered words, it’s almost entirely *self-gendering.* The speaker dictates their gender. In fact, using a lot of 3P pronouns is a telltale sign of a non-native speaker. 

I’m only *learning* Cantonese, because Chinatown has been my community for sixteen years, and I want to be more integrated into it, and like Spanish, it’s a safe and non-hostile language unlike English, but I really think the neutral 佢 and the fact that Mandarin 他/她 split is a post-colonial phenomenon deserves mention, just like the gendered names of professions that weren’t even in Japan prior to American imperialism that began with Perry and was the entire buildup to Pearl Harbour that Japanese Americans in high school in the ‘90s faced violence directly from and explicitly encouraged by teachers for, as well as the eradication of native NB genders and the whole « being queer is un-(ethnicity) because the white man said so, » you know, this whole and longstanding “those primitive Chah-neez and Mexi-cuns don’t understand queerness because they’re unenlightened unlike us whites who would never uwu” you know, I wasn’t planning this rant, but I’ve thought it before.

My evaluation of Japan’s LDP is also, well, they’re fash. Enough said. And also my opinion of America is frankly it isn’t progressive, it shouldn’t be classified a first-world nation anymore—no public healthcare and now there’s a whole class of *working homeless people* and the veneer of civility has been completely abandoned. 

That being said, yeah, I mean this definitely seems like baiting. Japan used to be the cheap “made in” country and Vincent Chin was *so* not the only person beaten or murdered for it, just Helen Zia actually managed to push so we know his name, because #saytheirnames still doesn’t apply to Asians because, as I’ve been told in the past couple of years, we’re not “ReAl PeOpLe uwu” 

Ikegami Akira had a great book around 2010 explaining the machinations behind current events. The US’ War On China, which is a repeat of the War On Japan, is because China is starting to innovate genuinely more interesting products while America’s become wholly risk averse. Look at how every third movie is yet another Spider-Man, how all Apple phones and all non-Apple phones America allows for sale are basically the same, just upsold with “40 quadzillion pixel oscillator” and “Internet imperceptibly faster than last time” and all this stuff that just really doesn’t make a difference to the human eye anymore, or photos that look downright *wrong,* and men’s clothes here are all of exactly two different cuts of three different outfits and frankly no one but 20 year old, seven foot tall, 12kg neo-yuppie can pull off.

This thing isn’t about human rights abuses any more than Japan/US WWII was about US standing against colonialism. US was doing the same thing as Japan then and China now. 

They’re both about inciting violence against Asians to create what they define as a “FrEe MaRkEt,” which is one where America wins, no matter how rigged and no matter the cost. This is simply because China is doing a better job at making products and money than America, and God forbid America actually put effort into something instead of get violent about it.",60,2021-09-12 01:30:16,asianamerican,t3_pmgzh1,t3_pmgzh1,hcib516,"0"

My advice, if you chose to take it xD, is just not to stress about it too much, usually at immersion schools there are a few parents that are part of a mixed race family. (For example the class that my child is in has at least 3 kids where one parent is not Chinese, and I think there's also a kid who wasn't Chinese at all but was sent there because the parents thought being bilingual is a good asset),  just get (or make) any fun-looking lantern that doesn't read TOO CNY-y (as in too oval + red), some examples [here](https://www.zhidiy.com/tupian/2015/aoakvzipmwp.jpg) and [here](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1Xdz6UjFX0/maxresdefault.jpg) and [here](https://uploadfile.huiyi8.com/up/f6/36/a7/f636a73493ada4191ca2eccaa77f0ef6.jpg) and [here](https://perak.chinapress.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ip190826ccmz08small.jpg).

In this case, though, these would be people passed out outside at night —not the violent jumping gunpoint murders right downtown in broad daylight where no one intervenes in America. Though yanno, honestly, the whole world’s changed. The dumbed-down Americanisation of schools that happened to people born ‘86 and later has resulted in anti-science, apparently, and who could forget the anti-special rights demos of the early 2010s? There’s apparently pro-war sentiment among that same generation (of course, fascism is also presented as literally the only other choice to ‘colonial white countries should be worshipped and *only* Japan was wrong in WWII » while the LDP fully embraces America to the point that all those women and the children US soldiers abandon with them are… not really talked about at all. I mean, the LDP is *horrible* to the Ryukyuans, we know this, but I mean even Yamato women in the Kanagawa area. This might sound like an odd position from America, but basically think of the LDP as the modern reinvention of the Meiji Revolution party, and it makes more sense) So, well, my idea of what life is actually *like* in Japan cuts off when I left Japan and my relatives back there had died, which was mid-1990s, so there might be more violent crime. The weapons ban dates back to Meiji as well and had to do with bringing down the Edo government. It went along with public humiliation by Americans of chopping men’s topknots off, which is why « uwu manbun » is a deep insult.

Racially motivated harassment—any kind of harassment—is never OK. This should not be limited to only protecting white cis women and black cis people. It should apply for anyone.

u/[deleted],"[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) \- This is the largest video sharing platform in China. I'm a person who likes to read comment sections, where you can find a lot of slang and common vocab/memes. Aside from following a few content creators, I also like to look up translated videos I'm already familiar with. For example, there are Chinese-subtitled Saturday Night Live clips uploaded to this. Since I'm already familiar with the skits, I like to focus and see how the OP decided to translate certain jokes into Chinese, or whether some of the jokes were even carried over in the translation (some translators are better than others).

[Weibo](https://weibo.com/) \- This is the Twitter/Facebook of China basically. You can follow accounts and there's a thing called ""超话"" that's like a subforum/community almost for various topics and celebrities and shows (basically anything). If you get this app on your phone, you'll want to get the Chinese version, not the international version, which doesn't have 超话s on it as far as I remember.

[Movie Douban](https://movie.douban.com/) \- This is the equivalent of IMDB and there are forums on here as well as simple movie reviews. Since I like to keep up with some Chinese releases that people don't necessarily log on Letterboxd (if you're familiar with it, it's a movie logging/reviewing site), I like to see what Chinese audiences have to say about films. You'd be surprised by how scathing they are sometimes 😂 

Douyin - This is the Chinese version of Tiktok (or rather, Tiktok is the international version of douyin?? Idk). This app is huge in China and reading the comments as well as watching the videos for this app has helped me learn most of my knowledge of Chinese memes lol. Also great for livestreams! I watched the Spring Festival Gala livestream just last night on douyin and right before I fell asleep there were 50 million people tuned in!

I think translating videos as well as simply watching them helps reinforce reading skills a lot too. I've gotten into translating douyin videos to share with friends who don't speak Mandarin or can't read Chinese and this helps a lot with determining the exact meaning of some words.",2,2022-02-01 01:16:20,asianamerican,t3_sgrx7c,t1_hv2jd5f,hv2mhf8,"0"

u/Zen1,"Identity is weird! I'm another person with quarter Japanese background, 6/8 of my great grandparents were immigrants from various places, but I'm named after a 4x great grandfather who emigrated from Ireland in the 1860s.

I grew up closest to my relatives who were full or half Japanese, my dad was out of touch with all of his Polish extended since he moved from PA to west coast as a child, his brother's family never really had any *Polish Heritage/culture,* there weren't any relatives from my mom's non-Japanese side around, so I ended up taking to the Japanese side of identity and culture, later majored in Japanese in college (coincidentally around the same time my grandma met another Nisei lady at golf and she started practicing her Japanese again). My freshman roommate was a British-Mexican dual citizen who had lighter skin than me! So we bonded on the shared experience of having an identity that doesn't fit into an easily defined box.

&amp;#x200B;

After college I went to Japan to teach English, so I've experienced many different sides of presenting my identity: I've been mistaken for full white or full Asian in both America AND Japan, both in negative and positive situations. While I was in Japan I dated a fellow English teacher from Hawaii who had a Korean-Japanese-White but not sure about details ethnic background. When people asked her she used to joke that she was exactly 1/3 each which could very well have been true about the cultural background in Hawaii! She had more Asian facial features than me, but spoke almost none of the language so we really confused the locals when we went out XD

I know people are over Robin DiAngelo and her book White Fragility, but this one passage points out that identity is layered and multifaceted even for people of a single racial/cultural background, kind of touching on the concepts of intersectionality. (sentence bolded by me for emphasis)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I will not be able to do justice to the complexity of multiracial identity. But for the purposes of grappling with white fragility, I offer multiracial people the concept of saliency. We all occupy multiple and intersecting social positionalities. I am white, but I am also a cisgender woman, able-bodied, and middle-aged. **These identities don’t cancel out one another; each is more or less salient in different contexts.** For example, in a group in which I am the only woman, gender will likely be very salient for me. When I am in a group that is all white except for one person of color, race will likely be my most salient identity.

&amp;#x200B;

Identity doesn't have to be one thing or the other! Learning to not let other people define it can be difficult, but it will be rewarding. Rather than ""not fitting in"", try to see the fluidity and flexibility as a gift!",4,2022-04-04 14:50:14,asianamerican,t3_tvwwi8,t3_tvwwi8,i3cwzp9,"0"

Anyways. I loved EEAAO. Watched it twice. Cried twice. I'd easily give it a 5/5. With that being said, I think this reviewer does bring up some good points.

They have me feeling especially conflicted about the issue of  stereotypes. When I saw the trailer, I was turned off because it felt like the movie was gonna play up these racial stereotypes for entertainment purposes. While it does stick to them, it also makes the characters emotionally resonant, which is where I disagree w the reviewer, I think it was a very emotional movie.

The movie presents relatable, heart-felt characters who, at the end of the day, still play entirely within the bounds of racial stereotypes that have been plaguing us. It's an interesting issue.

Also keep in mind anyone can say anything on letterboxd. It's basically reddit or twitter for movies. And this particular reviewer seems to specialize in *critical* criticism. Take a look at their profile.",6,2022-05-14 11:27:43,asianamerican,t3_up2j9e,t3_up2j9e,i8kdavm,"0"

If he keeps dropping racist comments just confront him about his racism. tell him to keep his comments to himself. because, even if he were racist, he should respect you enough to keep his racism away from you.

if you remain silent, you are complicit in his harrasment/racism. Stand up for yourself!

As for his comments, if you guys were to develop a friendlier relationship, you should get him to see that the same comments he drops to you can just as easily be applied to him. as much as he wants to reject his identity, he is who he is, and it comes off as extremely insecure when he criticizes himself.

u/suburbianbirb3434,"I don’t believe it’s appropriation, more inspiration.  Considering Newt studied creatures from all around the world it made sense to include mythological creatures from all over the world.   They had thunderbird from Native American culture in the first movie. Also a glimpse of a kappa from Japan in the 2nd. Phoenixes can be found in many mythologies from East to west. Even things like hypogriffs, basilisk, and dragons from Harry Potter films aren’t exactly original creatures but one that came from old European mythologies. 

I also think the reason why they have a lot of Chinese inspiration in general (zouwu in the 2nd movie, qilin in the 3rd) is because they are playing up to Chinese audience… since Harry Potter and Fantastic beasts do have a big fan base in China, and in Asia in general where many of these creatures are also known. 

I don’t believe old mythological creatures are really “owned” by anybody and is probably free usage maybe? Idk. 

I personally loved that they included the zouwu and qilin.  The zouwu becoming like a house cat with the feather toy was easily one of my favorite scenes in the 2nd movie.  

 People will always find something to complain about it seems. If you don’t include them it would’ve been “why didn’t they include more creatures from around the world?”

The only complaint I can agree with is Nagini…she kind of had the same energy as the Asian character in the Star Wars movie and the Asian girl from the Marvel Suicide Squad movie. One dimensional flat story line and they just included it last minute for meeting the quota of diversity.

u/lilaku,"^((prefacing this with an apology: i'm sorry for this huge wall of text that's sort of all over the place -- i've kinda given up on trying to edit this down anymore because all my thoughts are so interconnected and jumbled up together, and it's already taken so much effort to type out and edit as i was typing))

it's been over a decade since i first came out to my parents as a transwoman in my early twenties; i prefer not to go into details of the earlier years because of how traumatic it was (and because this comment is long enough as it is). i did initially come out in letter, but it was so awkwardly written, without any proper queer terminology, in broken chinese because my parents' english is significantly way worst than my cantonese, as they have always relied on me and my sister to translate things for them

we were pretty much a broken family for the first few years; dad with preexisting anger issues and constantly yelling, mom with her own childhood traumas and severe (nearly suicidal) depression since me coming out, my sister not wanting to deal with any of it and distancing herself from it all, and me struggling to express myself -- though to be honest i barely understood myself since i never had a proper and safe space to really discover who i really was

most of my twenties has been about self discovery and trying to figure out who i was on my own and who i want to become; all the while i was really trying to understand the world around me through a socio-politico-economic lens; though it wasn't until after a few psych ward hospitalizations in my mid twenties that my parents realized just how badly i was hurting mentally and emotionally from their rejection of me and my transition. i think that was when they really started to soften up and started making real efforts into trying to understand me

from that point on, my mom and i would talk regularly again. i shared with her a lot of what i've been learning about sexism, racism, classism, ableism, basically all the -isms, some intersectionality mixed in, and a bit of the histories of them all -- my mom has always been sort of a social history geek, despite her formal education completely failing her (cultural revolution era was not a good time for learning in china), so these conversations were sort of reminiscent of when she'd used to tell us about the social history of china when we were kids at the dinner table

in the twilight of my twenties into my thirties, i tried moving out to pursue a passion project of mine -- mostly because my parents still weren't very supportive of my life choices, but i sort of failed spectacularly, and ended up stressing out myself so much through a series of extremely unfortunate events back-to-back-to-back that i developed leukemia as a result XD i spent months at a time in isolation at the hospital during my chemotherapy

this was a physically excruciating and painfully lonely period of my life, but it gave me so much time for self reflection and introspection. i should mention that it was no secret that i've always hated myself for most of my life, and i've always constantly wished i was never born; but with nearly a decade of therapy under my belt, and so much free time to read and research cognitive and mental health issues, i finally figured out that i was actually extremely autistic; i learned to function well enough by masking and mimicking others (including those from tv/movies/games/other media) -- that is to say i became what 90s kid fear the most: a fucking poser; i was in denial about it for so long XD

humans have two really simple needs to thrive (besides of food and shelter that is): connection/closeness with others, and the ability to express ourselves authentically. i've known i was a girl before i was full socialized; in my earliest memories from age two to four, before i even understood the difference between genders, the deepest part of me knew, despite how contradictory that sounds. when i was still under five, and my sister still a toddler, i remember she gave me a pair of her pantyhose, which i decided to keep in a bag hung at my bedpost. i didn't realize i wasn't suppose to have it until my parents saw it and took it away. by age seven, i'd learned to hate myself for being a boy; and i would soon learn to be ashamed for feeling like a girl from many of the transphobic media of the 90s into the early 2000s -- this was the repression of my authentic self

language affects the way we think -- my cognition/firmware/ was bootstrapped in my native cantonese for the first five years of my life, but being a child of poor working class immigrants with no cantonese learning resources growing up in a small town outside of an enclave, my only option for mental operating system was english, which i didn't start until kindergarten (expelled from preschool for reasons i don't recall, and still don't quite understand) -- this contributed to a weird disconnect in my thinking that i still cannot properly explain with words in either language (much of my cognition is mostly set in feelings and emotions with some visual thoughts), and also contributed towards my inability to express my authentic self to those who i so very much want deep connections with

coupling those last two paragraphs, it makes perfect sense why i grew up the way i did. i had to move back in with my parents during my cancer treatment, but i didn't mind; my parents wanted to take care of me. there's an idiom that even my dad has used in this household: 百無禁忌 which roughly translates to ""nothing is taboo"" which carries a sort of positive message 'that one should be willing to stand out even if it's an idea or action that is new and not widely accepted'

ever since, i've started to delve deeper into studying my heritage, partly because i would love to be able to properly express myself and my thoughts in my native cantonese, but also because the more i learn about classical chinese thought, the more i realize we humans living in modern westernized societies could benefit from some of its teachings (this isn't just me talking, but from tenured professors from ivy league universities teaching humanities and classical chinese philosophies)

my parents and i talk all the time now, especially since covid19, with them working from home, and the increasing anti-asian/china sentiment, i share everything i've been learning with them; from health to history, sciences to societies, arts to agriculture, we talk about it all; i've grown so much spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and i'm so happy to have them be a part of, because i can see that they're also learning and growing with me as we continue to expand our worldview together; our relationship has never been closer in all my life

maybe it's because we live outside of an enclave, so my family is used to living at the fringe of society -- us doing our own thing as poor working class with little resources, not really assimilating or conforming to societal expectations; maybe it's because my mom has always exhibited daoist tendencies of going with the flow and not fighting against the tides and currents of life; maybe it's because my dad no longer works long hours at a stressful and physically demanding job that makes him short tempered all the time; and maybe it's a combination of all that and more, but what i do know is they if you and your parents are persistent enough in trying to reach an understanding with each other, together, you will reach a breakthrough. it might take some time if they react poorly at first, maybe even some space, but as long as there is care and love inside your hearts, you will find a way to connect

In that one comment. You claim that an entire country is inherently evil, and ANYTHING to counter the interests of 1.8b people is GOOD. Additionally, you go on to blame an entire global pandemic on a single country. This is especially ignorant given from your American perspective because it was EXTREMLY clear that our government mishandled covid response after the outbreak. You go on to dismiss any potential views of chinese citizens about their own government as ""brainwashing"". To top it all off, you rationalize the atrocities of imperial japan by claiming that China is worse.

This doesn't sound like someone who ""despises the government, but not the people.

In your reply, you then pray for the downfall of China's government. You do realize that the CCP, although not without its faults, has improved the well being of 2B people in the world? In 1949, people in china had limited access to food, shelter, and education. In the span of 70 years, those same people have been provided basic needs and securities they could only once dream of. Yet, you're openly wishing for a governmental collapse... have you seen what happens to a population when a government collapses? Wishing for reform is one thing, but wishing for governmental collapse isnt just ""hating the chinese government"".

youre not fooling anyone lmao. its fine if you want to spout hateful nonsense on the internet... you clearly spend alot of time on this site speaking ill about china, but don't hide behind the ""i hate the government but not the people"" schtick.",45,2022-07-28 06:03:26,asianamerican,t3_w9tq4j,t1_ihydnun,ihyhbfu,"0"

being able to understand my parents, where they came from and how they came to be the person that raised us, from an early age in my own upbringing really did help set up a foundation for us to be closer in adulthood. seeing how hard my parents worked throughout our childhood and understanding the hardships they experienced in their own childhood really did help me feel grateful for what we had, despite not having what a lot of my peers from school had

i've also always been interested in southern chinese culture and history of china, so it was really easy for me to connect with my mom, because she's a bit of a history buff herself and would read whatever classical and historical texts she could get her hands on in her youth even though they were banned during the cultural revolution

u/lilaku,"i'm also a huge fan of CJ from cool history bros, Liziqi, and all the talented folks at zide guqin studios, which i highly recommend as well, op!

another commenter mentioned that the ccp suppressed a lot of history and traditional culture via the cultural revolution of the 60s; my parents grew up poor during that period, so they still lament the proper education they never had in childhood, but they don't really resent the ccp today (lots of nuances to this, but they most blame chairman mao's machinations for control and power of the party)

anyway, ever since my remission from leukemia and moving back in with my parents, i started pursuing my own self guided heritage studies. i hard agree that to understand chinese culture and civilization as a whole (and even bits of korean and japanese), one must examine the building blocks of early china

zhou dynasty has had huge significance in shaping the zeitgeist of chinese thought which has had lasting impact even up to this day, from ruism (the proper name for what western scholars call confucianism) and its teachings from the first zhou king 周文王 - his posthumous name literally translating to the ""cultured king of zhou"" - to the hundred school of thoughts (諸子百家) during the spring and autumn period when the central zhou state's power waned into the warring states period

there is so much political and philosophical discourse during that time - most of which is now lost when 秦始皇 (first emperor of qin) kick started the imperial age following his victory out of the warring states. the qin dynasty was short lived though, and replaced by the han dynasty: the first golden age of china, where ruism flourished among the common folks and peasantry, and daoism grew into a prominent philosophical thought by absorbing various schools of thoughts that survived the book burnings of qin; buddhism also slowly started making it's way into china by the way of trade through the silk road during this period

i tried my best to keep this brief, but there is just so much rich history to unpack here that i want to keep going on and on XD (if i were to get into my favorite period of cultural development from pre-sui to tang dynasty - culture golden age of china - this whole comment would be five times as long)

i started a lot of my studies from introductory courses on edx.org platform (""free"" online courses from major university systems all over the world). most of the courses there aren't very comprehensive, especially the free courses, but still worth the time just to get a good overview that you can use as a roadmap to plan your own self guided heritage learning journey

there is one course i highly recommend, though i personally think it's better to just watch the lecture videos on youtube; the course is titled 
 [Chinese Thought: Ancient China Meets Modern Science](https://youtube.com/user/chinesethought) taught by professor Slingerland of university of british columbia. he covers much of the surviving philosophical thought from the periods i mentioned right up until the end of the warring states period. he also goes into how a lot of modern psychology and neuroscience actually validifies many of the views the ancient chinese sages held in regards to humanity and the nature of human beings

i also recommend a few video lectures/seminars featuring professor Michael Puett of harvard university. he's in [one video on youtube](https://youtu.be/-UY5xM7cRUk) where he shares his criticism of neoliberalism (under u.s. hegemony), and questions how contemporary china fits into the economic-political system of u.s.-led globalization while touching on how imperial china used to handle trade, commerce, economic activity and policies before western powers stepped up to the world stage (before 16th century)

as an extremely queer person, i would also be remiss if i didn't mention how misinformed the modern world is on historical chinese views towards non-heteronormative intimacy and relationship. ancient and imperial chinese societies didn't place any stigma on same sex romance until later christian missionaries came along after 17th century. [here is a link to episode three of the ""history is gay"" podcast](https://www.historyisgaypodcast.com/listen/2018/2/4/episode-3) where you can listen to the two host gush about how china has such a rich literary history featuring queer relationships

related to queerness: if you're into bl, i definitely recommend a short 12 episode donghua (chinese anime) called _heaven official's blessing (2020)_; it's not overtly queer or anything - gotta clear media censorship guidelines; but it does depict really handsomely brotherly love in a really soft way that is just super endearing. it's on netflix, but i think it's available elsewhere online for free as well

anyway sorry for the super long wall of text; i've sorta been learning so much about chinese history and our cultural heritage over the past three years; but i only really have my parents and one really close friend i can share this knowledge with, so i'm just overly excited to talk about some of this stuff with others who aren't disparaging towards anything chinese related 😅",2,2022-08-20 14:33:30,asianamerican,t3_wskuh4,t1_ikz7zyz,il2k8hh,"0"

This is only tangentially related but while we’re on the topic of genetics - I highly recommend that if there is any family history of heart issues or heart attacks, get testing done for heart protein markers!!! 

I just got back a lipoprotein (a) result which my doctor threw in “to be complete” and it is super high - and not related to lifestyle choices in any way :/ 

I told my brother that he should also get tested for Lipoprotein (a) since it is usually related to genetics 

I highly recommend the book Healthy Heart, Healthy Brain by Bradley Bale MD and Amy Doneen DNP - there is a lot in there about the GENETIC markers to test for, especially once you hit your 40’s, 50’s, and 60’s for certain proteins that build plaque

But it was after reading the first few chapters that I asked my doc about getting some of these proteins tested for that he “threw the test in” in addition to a regular lipids panel and Lo and behold - super freakin’ high 

I’m in my thirties btw so we only did that one test, not many of the others which are something to look out for in later ages - but I did make my parents read the book as well

u/artrockenthusiast,"Frankly, I don't think it should be put up with anywhere. The tack should be different, though, because we need to unite despite this very American propaganda that splits both diaspora and our home/ancestral countries (I assume most are born and raised here, but I'm first gen--1.5 exactly--so home goes for me) whereas whites are doing this both to shovel off the blame and to keep us split. 

I don't come at Chinese people with accusations of the warped story of Beijing Protests that have gone from what it was like (like BLM protests except BLM also had the devastation of our OK to oppress minority communities because it's de facto legal whereas Beijing had sporadic fighting just between demoers and officials around the city. Not only do I remember this being on NHK--every granparent's fave and some parents' faves--but CBS archives and people who were there agree with me. Yet it was warped into the US event of the hippy and the flower. I don't come at them (go at them?) with any of that. I don't blame them for US media saying Chairman Xi banned queerness on TV (actually, depending how new it was, local formerly pan-Asian now mostly Mandarin and Cantonese channel may've aired proof positive that wasn't even true a few weeks ago) I don't go at Koreans blaming them for, I dunno, whoever's latest speech in DPRK (I mean, I've been around a while) or uuuahhhhh new missile in the sea CNN FOX NEWS FOOTAGE OMG or any of that. 

I'm not gonna come after a Filipino or something for writing random JP into something the way I absolutely will an AmERiCaN (tm), but this stuff if coming from an Asian is being a Obedient Asian and pointing the gun at another Asian's head. Never mind it's also the same sort of propaganda most of the time that has me being demanded to apologise for Indians EaTiNg DoG uwu. There's also usually complete forgiveness or omission for Britain, France by those people. Complete omission of Korea being in the same boat in modern times as Japan and actually more conservative and specifically conservative Christian, complete omission Japanese people are capable of good because cartoons are so last season. 

I dunno, when Asians do do it (it's usually AsAms. Possibly/probably with ancestral grudges exacerbated by not having access to *anything but* Western hot takes. Since me and most of my community is immigrants, I should probably clarify. At the bare minimum, Asia Asians keep that for when people of the country they've been pitted against aren't around because manners, friendship, and kindness aren't considered weaknesses as they are here) it's from a different place, but at least they could stop being hypocritical about it and claiming ""pan-Asian"" or ""anti-US Propaganda""

taiwanese immigrant family drama, directed by alan yang (writer for parks and rec and master of none). i would consider this like yi yi (2000)'s american spinoff. apparently not super good

**everything everywhere all at once**
chinese-american laundromat with financial struggles, ADHD, generational trauama

sorry if what i'm about to say is disorganized i'm just going to vomit out some stuff

i 100% agree i think asian american media stagnated once hollywood figured out they just have to stick with a single generation of actors. it's all east asian actors and stories with the occasional southeast asian actor sprinkled in. if there's a south asian it's probably dev patel. there's no love for my bengali/south indian homies :( and i long for the day they cast manny jacinto as the main protagonist. bro's HOT

if you ask me personally i think there's too many drama films centered around asian trauma. i remember reading one letterboxd review that was like...

*""enough movies with generational trauma i'm done healing""*

what i would love most are drama films that look to the *future* of asian american culture. i want films that ask where do we go from here and start to question the status quo politically and culturally. the more films that make non-asian people uncomfortable the better you know?",1,2023-08-01 01:26:58,asianamerican,t3_15ex8po,t3_15ex8po,juaa6pm,"0"

u/artrockenthusiast,"I stayed in CA because I'm never gonna be the only Asian in my neighbourhood again. Been there, done, done, done. 

I do know that local Japanese-language free newspapers were HARD pushing real estate in TX, particularly Dallas, for a while. 

My understanding about Dallas being a political climate for ALPOC to live is... it's not a great one. 

I settled in CA 19 years ago, and honestly, if I leave CA, I go back to Japan. I'm currently attempting to flee the area I am to another part of CA; neither Los nor SF are great for non-STEM Asians (who, if you're not STEM, you're cleaning toilets, basically) but some of the more ALPOC-dominant suburbs seem legit. Also less ""TERFism is Twue Weft"" and all other ""UwU sO wOqUe"" garbage. (Basically hate disguised as progressivism, including WMB 2.0, wherein after forcing capitalism, queerphobia, and Western racist class-caste ideology among other toxic things, down E/SE Asia's throat in the original WMB, now Teh Inlyitund West must Teech Teh Savij Orientulz How To Tolerinse🤡 and this is rampant here as an excuse to deny us help or justice, along with recycling antisemitic conspiracy theories against us)

Honestly, it's pretty hard to find a good place for us. Another big reason it is is because propaganda keeps old wounds from healing or wholly creates wounds and divides, as well as gaslighting even those of us who came over ourselves (1.5 gen) and so, there really isn't an actual unified AsAm comm. And anything any of us build, both extreme right and their neolib rival buddies justify destroying and refusing to restore anything or even acknowledge what's done to us. So this is why it's uniquely hard for us. If we all could come together, we could at least go off on our own and build stuff together along the lines of how, say, Univision exists. (Granted, you'd need programming split into language blocks and papers to have editions in different languages, but that's nothing that can't be done if it was possible to bring us all together)",1,2023-08-28 03:18:18,asianamerican,t3_162ruce,t3_162ruce,jy1mti0,"0"
u/artrockenthusiast,"Well, I just found a reply I made on Bleach forum correcting the Western narrative that ""Teh Backwurdz Orient"" is queerphobic (unlike the Civilised West (tm), which Japan has had trans Congresspeople and America has Congress bills to ban trans existence) and that's actually fairly normal, so my guess is silencing Asians or just anything that hurts Naruhtiv

Meet nice people and mean people. Even when I dealt with a racist woman, I would scoff and laugh and reveal how sexist I can be. So hold your head up high, and don't worry about it. You can find better work, and working under that woman would not go well in the long run. She will run the company to the ground sooner or later just for being a woman. You will be okay.
