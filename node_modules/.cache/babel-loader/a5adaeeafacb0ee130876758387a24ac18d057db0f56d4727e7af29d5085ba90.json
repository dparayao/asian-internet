This includes code-switching or using AAVE to align with certain identities or challenge stereotypes, as seen in research by Shankar (2011). Similarly, Dich (2012) explains online communities allowed Asian diaspora to construct an Asian American identity and form digital ethnic enclaves that allowed them to reject stereotypes and claim both Asian and American identities.\\n\\n  Thus, we can extend this idea of language forming diaspora identities in youth to understanding how the Asian diaspora used internet language within online communities to create and express their identities from the 2000s to early 2020s. \\n\\n  We see the creation of online ethnic enclaves reflected in the creation of internet slang terms, as only those belonging to this community of Asian diaspora would be able to understand and correctly use these terms online. The continual use of these slang terms online and propagation to real life (through word of mouth, YouTube, TikTok) over time as shown in the visualizations has indicated that Asian-Americans have successfully developed widely used internet language to express their identities, allowing other Asian Americans to cultivate their own understanding of their cultural identity by engaging in online spaces. \\n\\n  Additionally, the trends of various identity terms across subreddits and time periods highlight how the online Asian diaspora has adopted sustaining terms to describe themselves. For example, Salinas and Trazo (2023) state that \\\"AZN\\\" was used in the 1990s and 2000s in reference to Asian American pride movements, and was propagated through early internet platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger, chatrooms, MySpace, Friendster and Xanga. Our frequency visualizations demonstrate that \\u201CAZN\\u201D and other terms created during that era such as \\u201CFOB\\u201D have sustained over time as they are still used in online communities today.\\n\\n  Finally, according to our visualizations, the meanings and sentiments of these slang words change with the adoption of new media. For instance, Salinas and Trazo (2023) explain how the mainstreaming of the ABG aesthetic through platforms like TikTok highlights how this term has been adapted by the Asian diaspora to have a different meaning over time.\\n        \"}]},casestudy:{id:'casestudy',title:'Case Study: ABG',content:[{title:'Twitter 2006-2017 Data',component:'twitter',text:'While I did also scrape 500 tweets from 2006-2011, the correlation between those tweets and my intended meaning of the slang term “ABG” or “Asian Baby Girl” wasn’t strong enough to use it in my data, as Twitter was still very new and most tweets consisted of people talking about their Asian babies.

For the Twitter word clouds it\\u2019s important to note that Jungkook came out with a song called 3D in 2023 that had the word \\u201CABG\\u201D, sparking conversations around the term on twitter.\\n\\n  The 2011-2017 Twitter word cloud associates \\u201CABG\\u201D with \\u201Cgangster\\u201D and \\u201Chot\\u201D, and with popular Asian diaspora terms like \\u201Cboba\\u201D.

Additionally, terms such as \\u201Cthink\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople\\u201D suggest that there are discussions about the meaning of this term.\\n\\n  The Tiktok and 2017-2023 Twitter word clouds demonstrate a clear shift in the word being an identifier to a commodified aesthetic with words such as \\u201Cmakeup\\u201D, \\u201Chairstyle\\u201D, \\u201Cviral\\u201D, and \\u201Cfashionista\\u201D. \\n          \"},{title:'How does the co-option or appropriation of subcultural language such as “ABG” by mainstream groups affect its original communities?',text:\"\\n  In the context of \\u201CABG\\u201D, we can analyze our word clouds to see how the rise of TikTok has allowed mainstream groups to adopt this term and turn it from an identity marker to a commodifiable aesthetic.\\n\\n  \\u201CThe Asian Baby Girl (ABG) Through a Filipina American Lens\\u201D highlights how this commodification has affected its original community that created the term, which the author traces back to sister gangs created out of underfunded BIPOC urban spaces where East Asian and Southeast Asian refugees settled. According to Salinas and Trazo (2023), \\u201CFilipinas and other Southeast Asian women who were part of these gangs were also mingling and sharing space and coalitions with Chicana and Black sister gangs\\u201D and thus heavily borrowed aesthetics from these communities as well.\\n\\n  As it became popular, the ABG look spread through commercial media such as the Fast and Furious franchise and the For Him magazine, turning ABGs into 2D portrayals for the male gaze. Salinas and Trazo (2023) argue these media \\u201Cobscure the real issues that Asian American women were facing on the ground in the streets of neglected Asian American communities of California like Los Angeles, San Diego and their issues within underfunded but heavily policed communities, their lack of public education and health resources, and the real sexual violence they experienced as sexual accessories in some of these gang circles also went unheard while their images onscreen became more remakes of America\\u2019s fascination with the oversexed Asian woman\\u201D.\\n\\n  With TikTok, ABG has been transformed from a subculture to an aesthetic describing Asian girls who get their nails done, drink boba and go to nightclubs, while participating in global consumerism such as fast-fashion. Salinas and Trazo (2023) also say, \\u201Cthe ABG asserts her hyperfemininity and hypersexualization through her cultural consumption and, borrowing the term Jillian Hernandez uses to describe the Latina \\u2018chonga\\u2019, \\u2018aesthetic excess\\u2019\\u201D. We see this trend reflected in our word clouds, as associated words change from \\u201Cgangster\\u201D and \\u201Chot\\u201D to \\u201Cmakeup\\u201D and \\u201Cviral\\u201D. \\n\\n  Additionally, while these word clouds feature Asian ethnicities, they primarily associate ABG with East Asian ethnicities such as \\u201CKorean\\u201D or \\u201CChinese\\u201D, rather than Southeast Asian ethnicities. We also see in the TikTok word cloud the term \\u201CDouyin\\u201D which is considered the \\u201CChinese Version of TikTok\\u201D, showing the adoption of ABG by an international East Asian audience. Such associations contribute further to the fetishization of East Asian women and the erasure of Southeast Asian women in popular culture. This association is also harmful considering the term ABG originated from Southeast Asian women like Filipinos and Vietnamese women living in underserved urban spaces, and became a positive aesthetic when East Asian women adopted it online.\\n          \"}]},conclusion:{id:'conclusion',title:'Conclusion',content:[{title:'How has Asian-influenced internet language evolved from early internet spaces to modern platforms, and how does its usage reflect broader patterns of cultural appropriation, identity formation, and aesthetic adoption in digital spaces?',text:\"\\n  Internet slang terms such as \\u201CAZN\\u201D, \\u201CFOB\\u201D and \\u201CABG\\u201D were created by the Asian diaspora in the early 2000s and spread through online platforms such as Xanga, helping form online ethnic enclaves for Asian American youth.

This includes code-switching or using AAVE to align with certain identities or challenge stereotypes, as seen in research by Shankar (2011). Similarly, Dich (2012) explains online communities allowed Asian diaspora to construct an Asian American identity and form digital ethnic enclaves that allowed them to reject stereotypes and claim both Asian and American identities.\n\n  Thus, we can extend this idea of language forming diaspora identities in youth to understanding how the Asian diaspora used internet language within online communities to create and express their identities from the 2000s to early 2020s. \n\n  We see the creation of online ethnic enclaves reflected in the creation of internet slang terms, as only those belonging to this community of Asian diaspora would be able to understand and correctly use these terms online. The continual use of these slang terms online and propagation to real life (through word of mouth, YouTube, TikTok) over time as shown in the visualizations has indicated that Asian-Americans have successfully developed widely used internet language to express their identities, allowing other Asian Americans to cultivate their own understanding of their cultural identity by engaging in online spaces. \n\n  Additionally, the trends of various identity terms across subreddits and time periods highlight how the online Asian diaspora has adopted sustaining terms to describe themselves. For example, Salinas and Trazo (2023) state that \"AZN\" was used in the 1990s and 2000s in reference to Asian American pride movements, and was propagated through early internet platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger, chatrooms, MySpace, Friendster and Xanga. Our frequency visualizations demonstrate that “AZN” and other terms created during that era such as “FOB” have sustained over time as they are still used in online communities today.\n\n  Finally, according to our visualizations, the meanings and sentiments of these slang words change with the adoption of new media. For instance, Salinas and Trazo (2023) explain how the mainstreaming of the ABG aesthetic through platforms like TikTok highlights how this term has been adapted by the Asian diaspora to have a different meaning over time.\n        `\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    casestudy: {\n      id: 'casestudy',\n      title: 'Case Study: ABG',\n      content: [\n        {\n          title: 'Twitter 2006-2017 Data',\n          component: 'twitter',\n          text: 'While I did also scrape 500 tweets from 2006-2011, the correlation between those tweets and my intended meaning of the slang term “ABG” or “Asian Baby Girl” wasn’t strong enough to use it in my data, as Twitter was still very new and most tweets consisted of people talking about their Asian babies.

For the Twitter word clouds it’s important to note that Jungkook came out with a song called 3D in 2023 that had the word “ABG”, sparking conversations around the term on twitter.\n\n  The 2011-2017 Twitter word cloud associates “ABG” with “gangster” and “hot”, and with popular Asian diaspora terms like “boba”. However, similar to the 2006-2011 Twitter data from my Custom Twitter Dataset (2023)\", it still highly associates it with the word “adopt”, indicating that people still discussed the term in the context of adopting babies.\n\n  We can look at r/aznidentity and r/asianamerican word clouds to see that more cultural and identity related terms are associated with “ABG”, such as “American”, showing that people in this community viewed it as an American concept. Additionally, terms such as “think” and “people” suggest that there are discussions about the meaning of this term.\n\n  The Tiktok and 2017-2023 Twitter word clouds demonstrate a clear shift in the word being an identifier to a commodified aesthetic with words such as “makeup”, “hairstyle”, “viral”, and “fashionista”. \n          `\n        },\n        {\n          title: 'How does the co-option or appropriation of subcultural language such as “ABG” by mainstream groups affect its original communities?',\n          text: `\n  In the context of “ABG”, we can analyze our word clouds to see how the rise of TikTok has allowed mainstream groups to adopt this term and turn it from an identity marker to a commodifiable aesthetic.\n\n  “The Asian Baby Girl (ABG) Through a Filipina American Lens” highlights how this commodification has affected its original community that created the term, which the author traces back to sister gangs created out of underfunded BIPOC urban spaces where East Asian and Southeast Asian refugees settled. According to Salinas and Trazo (2023), “Filipinas and other Southeast Asian women who were part of these gangs were also mingling and sharing space and coalitions with Chicana and Black sister gangs” and thus heavily borrowed aesthetics from these communities as well.\n\n  As it became popular, the ABG look spread through commercial media such as the Fast and Furious franchise and the For Him magazine, turning ABGs into 2D portrayals for the male gaze. Salinas and Trazo (2023) argue these media “obscure the real issues that Asian American women were facing on the ground in the streets of neglected Asian American communities of California like Los Angeles, San Diego and their issues within underfunded but heavily policed communities, their lack of public education and health resources, and the real sexual violence they experienced as sexual accessories in some of these gang circles also went unheard while their images onscreen became more remakes of America’s fascination with the oversexed Asian woman”.\n\n  With TikTok, ABG has been transformed from a subculture to an aesthetic describing Asian girls who get their nails done, drink boba and go to nightclubs, while participating in global consumerism such as fast-fashion. Salinas and Trazo (2023) also say, “the ABG asserts her hyperfemininity and hypersexualization through her cultural consumption and, borrowing the term Jillian Hernandez uses to describe the Latina ‘chonga’, ‘aesthetic excess’”. We see this trend reflected in our word clouds, as associated words change from “gangster” and “hot” to “makeup” and “viral”. \n\n  Additionally, while these word clouds feature Asian ethnicities, they primarily associate ABG with East Asian ethnicities such as “Korean” or “Chinese”, rather than Southeast Asian ethnicities. We also see in the TikTok word cloud the term “Douyin” which is considered the “Chinese Version of TikTok”, showing the adoption of ABG by an international East Asian audience. Such associations contribute further to the fetishization of East Asian women and the erasure of Southeast Asian women in popular culture. This association is also harmful considering the term ABG originated from Southeast Asian women like Filipinos and Vietnamese women living in underserved urban spaces, and became a positive aesthetic when East Asian women adopted it online.\n          `\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    conclusion: {\n      id: 'conclusion',\n      title: 'Conclusion',\n      content: [{\n        title: 'How has Asian-influenced internet language evolved from early internet spaces to modern platforms, and how does its usage reflect broader patterns of cultural appropriation, identity formation, and aesthetic adoption in digital spaces?',\n        text: `\n  Internet slang terms such as “AZN”, “FOB” and “ABG” were created by the Asian diaspora in the early 2000s and spread through online platforms such as Xanga, helping form online ethnic enclaves for Asian American youth. Our visualizations analyzing r/asianamerican and r/aznidentity demonstrate how such slang has become part of Asian American online identity.\n\n  Platforms such as TikTok have allowed mainstream audiences to participate in internet slang. As shown in our case study of “ABG”, online platforms allow global audiences to adopt aesthetics without consequences, as seen by “ABG’s” trajectory from an identity marker to a style that erases its origins from a subculture of Southeast Asian women in underserved urban communities. As a result, “ABG”, similar to other languages created by marginalized groups such as AAVE, has become a trend for global audiences to consume.\n\n  Although Asian Americans have successfully created their own language to express their diasporic identities and create ethnic enclaves online, the appropriation of certain terms as they enter mainstream digital spaces negatively impact their original communities. While it’s natural for the meaning and sentiment of terms to change over time as different audiences are introduced to them, Asian American slang offers an interesting study as it encapsulates what it means to be an Asian diaspora youth negotiating your identity while growing up in the Age of the Internet of Things.\n        `\n      }]\n    },\n    references: {\n      id: 'references',\n      title: 'References & Citations',\n      content: [{\n        title: 'References & Citations',\n        text: `Dich, L.
